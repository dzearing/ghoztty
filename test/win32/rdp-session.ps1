# Remote Desktop session acceptance (tracker T1253).
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. T1249, T1251 and T1252 taught the terminal to explain,
# then survive, a display driver whose OpenGL is below the renderer's floor -
# and all three are proved by PRETENDING. `GHOZTTY_GL_FORCE_VERSION` moves the
# number a context reports and nothing else. The failure the user actually hit
# was a whole environment: reached from a MacBook over Microsoft's Windows App
# on 2026-09-01, where the display driver really is that old, the desktop is
# encoded and shipped over a wire, the DPI and the monitor topology are the
# CLIENT's, and window composition behaves differently. A pass under the seam
# says the fallback path runs. It does not say the terminal is usable there,
# and nobody had ever watched Ghoztty launch inside an RDP session.
#
# So this script asserts nothing at all unless it is running inside one. That
# is the whole design: it is not a test with a skip branch, it is a test whose
# subject IS the session it runs in.
#
# THE CONTRACT it asserts, inside a real remote session:
#
#   A. The session really is remote, and what it is gets WRITTEN DOWN -
#      SM_REMOTESESSION, the client name, the display adapter, the desktop
#      geometry and DPI. Every number below is only as interesting as the
#      environment it was taken in, so the environment is evidence, not
#      preamble.
#   B. Ghoztty LAUNCHES: a `GhozttyWindow` comes up, and the T1177
#      startup-failure dialog does not. The refusal and the window are the two
#      endings of the same condition and only one of them is acceptable here.
#   C. The renderer's own account names the implementation it drew with and the
#      GL the session actually offers - `loaded OpenGL <maj>.<min>
#      renderer="..." vendor="..." impl=system|fallback`. Whichever way it
#      went is a RESULT: on this display `impl=fallback` is the T1251/T1252
#      path doing its job, and `impl=system` means the session's driver clears
#      4.3 on its own. What would be a defect is the app coming up with no
#      account of either.
#   D. `ghoztty +list` answers over the remote session the way it does locally.
#      The named pipe is per-user and session-agnostic by construction, which
#      is a claim nobody had ever run.
#   E. Frame pacing is MEASURED, not asserted. `GHOZTTY_PERF` samples are
#      collected off a pane under a sustained stream and the median fps and
#      worst inter-frame gap are recorded here and in the artifact. The task is
#      explicit that slow-but-working is a result and belongs in a follow-up
#      rather than a red run, so the assertion is that samples EXIST - a run
#      that measured nothing is the failure, a run that measured 12 fps is a
#      finding.
#   F. Session restore behaves: a named window recorded in the manifest comes
#      back under the same name after the app is killed and relaunched. Restore
#      is the feature most likely to be quietly broken by a different desktop,
#      because it puts windows back at coordinates the last session chose.
#   G. A dimmed viewer pane does not KEEP getting dimmer (T1316, for T1295).
#      Someone reported over RDP that an HTML pane's white faded the longer it
#      sat there, and closing and reopening it fixed it for a while. T1295's fix
#      landed - the unfocused-split overlay stopped re-blending when nothing had
#      changed, and it resets the pixels under itself in a remote session - but
#      nothing on this box could tell whether it worked, because the symptom is
#      composited pixels over a wire and the only oracle to date was asking the
#      reporter to stare at a pane again. So the arm opens a white viewer pane
#      in a split, moves focus off it so the T74 dim overlay IS showing, and
#      samples the pane's composited pixels for a couple of minutes.
#
#      The assertion is a DRIFT BOUND, not an absolute brightness: the pane is
#      SUPPOSED to look dimmer than the focused one, and how dim depends on
#      `unfocused-split-opacity`, the fill and the client's own colour
#      handling. What it must never do is keep going. Every sample is written
#      into the artifact the way arm E's fps is, because a number nobody wrote
#      down has to be re-earned on a machine the next reader may not have.
#
#      A steady reading here is a RESULT, not a shrug: if the reporter still
#      sees the fade while the server's own desktop reads flat, the blend is
#      accumulating in the RDP CLIENT or the redirection path, and that is
#      where T1295 reopens rather than in `DimOverlay.zig`.
#
#      It RUNS between E and F despite its letter: F kills the app and relaunches
#      it, and a two-minute pixel series wants the instance whose panes arms B
#      through E have already been talking to. The letters name the contract, and
#      the contract gained one at the end.
#
# WHY IT RUNS ON THE INTERACTIVE DESKTOP (the default here, unlike every other
# GUI script in this suite). `lib\TestDesktop.ps1` exists so acceptance never
# takes the user's foreground - but a background desktop is never composited
# and never presented, so frames drawn on it are not shipped over the RDP wire.
# Arm E would then measure a renderer talking to nothing, which is precisely
# the number this script exists to get right. Whoever runs this is deliberately
# sitting in an RDP session watching it, so the foreground is theirs to lend.
# `-BackgroundDesktop` is available for the arms that do not care.
#
# HOW TO GET A SESSION. This box cannot make one for itself: Windows 11 Pro
# serves one interactive session at a time, so an RDP connection from anywhere
# - localhost included - DISCONNECTS the console rather than joining it. It
# takes a second machine:
#
#   1. On this box: Settings > System > Remote Desktop, on. (`qwinsta` should
#      list `rdp-tcp ... Listen`.)
#   2. From the other machine (Microsoft's Windows App on macOS, or mstsc),
#      connect to this box and sign in as the same user.
#   3. In the remote session:
#        powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\rdp-session.ps1
#
# Run on the console it prints ASSERTED NOTHING and exits 2, which is the
# demonstration that it cannot be satisfied from the wrong place - the same
# reason `gate-negatives.ps1` exists for the loop's gates.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\rdp-session.ps1

# is the COMPOSITE - the viewer's own surface with the layered dim overlay
# blended on top of it - and PrintWindow of either window on its own produces
# exactly the two halves whose combination is the subject. That is why this
# script is a declared input-desktop exception in lib\TestDesktop.ps1: on a
# background desktop DWM composes nothing and this reads black.
#
# The region is averaged rather than point-sampled: a compounding blend moves
# the whole pane, while a single pixel can land on a glyph, a scrollbar or a
