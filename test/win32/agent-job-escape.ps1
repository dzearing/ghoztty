# T426 acceptance: the LOCAL AGENT is spawned OUTSIDE the app's job object.
#
# The defect: `LocalAgent.spawnAgent` used a plain CreateProcessW with
# DETACHED_PROCESS, and DETACHED_PROCESS does not leave a job. A child joins its
# parent's job by default, this box's jobs are kill-on-close, and a job teardown
# kills every member at once - the mechanism T524 measured when four relaunch
# guards died with the app before executing one instruction. A daemon that owns
# every persistent PTY, and whose entire reason to exist is outliving the app,
# must not be a member of anything that can kill it on the app's account.
#
# Measured by OUTCOME, not by log scraping: the agent process's own job
# membership, probed with IsProcessInJob against the exact job handle the app
# was jailed in, and then its survival of that job's teardown.
#
#   A: premise - the app under test is up and jailed in a kill-on-close job.
#   B: the agent it then spawns lands OUTSIDE that job.
#   C: ... and SURVIVES the job's teardown (TerminateJobObject), which is the
#      thing the membership test is a proxy for.
#   D: negative control - a process the app spawns WITHOUT the escape (this
#      script's own child, spawned plainly from the jailed app's job) IS in the
#      job and DOES die with it. Without this arm, a job that never kills
#      anything would pass B and C.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA and a private IPC pipe suffix, and it
# only ever touches ghoztty processes launched from the -Exe under test.
#
#   E: T674 - the escape holds with NO SHELL WINDOW. `-TestDesktop` runs the
#      same measurement on the background test desktop, where GetShellWindow()
#      answers nothing and tier 2 therefore cannot fire; the app must reach the
#      jobless-donor tier instead of degrading into the job. Before T674 this
#      arm was the one place the escape was conditional, and a Ghoztty started
#      from a service or a scheduled task was in exactly that position.
