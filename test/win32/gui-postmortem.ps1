# T527 - a process that dies during an acceptance run must say WHY.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Twice on 2026-08-06 the Debug GUI vanished mid-run with
# no panic and no crash-looking tail: the stderr log's last line was an ordinary
# `info(win32_ipc): IPC: received action 'read'` and then end of file. Twenty-six
# later asserts failed for the wrong reason and the investigation had nothing to
# work with, because the harness had never read the one number that separates
# the two possible stories - the exit code. An unhandled exception leaves an
# NTSTATUS there and an `Application Error` record in the Windows log; a
# deliberate ExitProcess leaves a small integer and no record. Those are
# different bugs.
#
# So what is under test is not "does the helper run". It is: does a REAL access
# violation launched through the same path the GUI is launched through come back
# named, does a silent ExitProcess come back distinguished FROM a crash rather
# than folded into it, is the exit code readable at all once the process is gone
# (it is not, unless a handle was held from launch), and does the teardown report
# a death nobody asked about while staying silent about the processes it killed
# itself.
#
# isolation: none - this script never launches ghoztty and never runs a CLI
# verb. It builds a scratch crasher, runs cmd.exe, and reads the Application
# event log; there is no IPC endpoint to isolate.
