# T285 + T286 acceptance: the win32 Activity Monitor panel and its process
# control.
#
# T284 built the arithmetic (activity_layout.zig / trend_gauge.zig) and T285
# built the window: an owner-drawn panel fed by the LOCAL process/metrics
# samplers, opened from the command palette, one panel per source.
#
# What only the running app can answer, and what this script asserts:
#
#   A. the palette command opens a real top-level `GhozttyActivityMonitor`
#      window titled "Activity - Local", with the three native controls the
#      layout module places (filter EDIT, "Show all" checkbox, a "New Process..."
#      button that is DISABLED until T286 gives it something to do);
#   B. the table POPULATES - the local sampler really ran and produced rows;
#   C. the registry FOCUSES rather than duplicates: a second palette invocation
#      leaves exactly one panel and says so;
#   D. the filter narrows the table, including against a KNOWN pid (the app's
#      own), and a needle that matches nothing empties it;
#   D2. (T989) an over-long filter - typed past the old 130-character crash
#      threshold, then pasted, then pasted as three-byte characters - leaves the
#      app RUNNING, with no panic in its log and the table still filtering;
#   E. "Show all" widens it from the ghoztty-spawned tree to every process;
#   H. (T286) "New Process..." opens a modal dialog whose Start is disabled
#      until a command is typed, and starting one puts a REAL process on the box
#      and a row for it in the table;
#   I. (T286) Kill appears only with a selection, its confirmation names the
#      process and its pid, CANCELLING LEAVES THE PROCESS ALIVE (the negative
#      control for "the confirmation is mandatory") and confirming terminates it;
#      (T292) the panel KEEPS POLLING behind that open dialog, and a kill
#      confirmed after several snapshots have been retired underneath it still
#      lands on the right pid;
#   J. (T286) a failed action raises the dismissable error banner, and clicking
#      its glyph removes it;
#   K. (T290) a panel nobody can see does not enumerate: minimizing STOPS the
#      1.5s process sweep, restoring resumes it within one interval, and the
#      resume clears the trend history rather than stitching a gap across it;
#   L. (T289) keyboard focus is VISIBLE and it ROUTES: Tab walks filter ->
#      "Show all" -> [Kill] -> "New Process..." -> table and steps over a Kill
#      that is not on screen, (T569) Shift+Tab walks the same ring backwards -
#      the one-step route from the filter to the table - the row keys reach the
#      table only while the TABLE
#      holds focus, and the table - an owner-drawn region no theme rings for us
#      - paints design system 2.2's ring on its caret row exactly while it has
#      the keyboard; (T568) including when the PANEL loses the keyboard rather
#      than another stop inside it taking it - deactivated outright, and with a
#      sibling window holding it - which T289 could not assert at all;
#   N. (T567) the column headings have a KEYBOARD route to the sort: while the
#      table holds focus Left/Right walk a cursor along the headings, that cursor
#      draws design system 2.2's indicator on the column it is on (and the caret
#      row's rim yields to it, so the panel never shows two), Space commits the
#      column under it and flips its direction on a second press, and a vertical
#      key puts the cursor away and moves the rows in the same keystroke;
#   M. (T293) a MULTI-ROW kill: ctrl-click and shift-click really accumulate a
#      selection, the button re-captions to "Kill 3" as it grows, the
#      confirmation counts the batch instead of naming a pid, a clean sweep
#      reports killed=3 failed=0 with no banner, and a batch in which one row is
#      already gone takes the AGGREGATED "Killed 2 of 3 (1 failed: ...)" branch.
#   O. (T570) Kill answers the KEYBOARD, end to end and with no mouse in it: a
#      row selected with Down, three Tabs onto Kill, Space to open the
#      confirmation - which opens with CANCEL holding the keyboard, so a bare
#      Enter kills NOTHING - then Space, Tab onto the "Kill" affirmative and
#      Enter, which terminates the process. D29 kept the remote script's
#      negative control off Kill because that panel samples a live machine;
#      this is the same claim made where the victim is one the script spawned.
#
# NOTHING THE BOX NEEDS IS EVER A TARGET. H spawns `cmd.exe /C pause` - a
# throwaway that blocks forever with no child process - and I only ever kills
# the pid the confirmation dialog ITSELF named, so a mis-targeted row makes the
# script fail rather than kill a bystander. M cannot name a pid (its dialog
# counts rows instead), so it makes the same guarantee structurally: its victims
# are `ping -n 600 127.0.0.1` children of the panel's own spawns, and with "Show
# all" turned back OFF the needle "ping" matches nothing else in the app's own
# process tree - so every row on screen while it clicks is one of its own. That
# is asserted at EVERY click and not only before the first: the first run of M
# left "Show all" on, and the box's own ping joined the table between the check
# and the clicks.
#
# ORACLE. A GDI-painted table has no text to read back, so the oracle is the
# app's own log line, emitted by `ActivityMonitor.rebuild` on every input
# change:
#
#   activity monitor: source=Local total=312 shown=7 needle="" show_all=false ...
#
# That is a derivation of the same state the painter walks, not a restatement of
# the assertion - `rebuild` computes `order_len` and then both paints it and
# logs it. A row count that is logged but not painted would still be a defect,
# which is why A also asserts the window and its controls exist for real.
#
# CONTROLS. A positive control (ctrl+shift+p opening the palette) runs first, so
# a broken injection aborts instead of reading as a T285 regression. The
# `-NegativeControl` switch inverts three load-bearing claims - D's (a needle
# that matches nothing is asserted to still show every row), L's (the focus ring
# is asserted to be painted while the FILTER holds focus) and L7's (it is
# asserted to survive the panel being DEACTIVATED) - and that run MUST fail.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1)
# and asserts at the end that it never took the user's foreground. The panel is
# a native window, so `Get-TestWindows` / `Find-TestWindowEx` read it faithfully
# (the capture limit is only the OpenGL terminal surface).
#
# T248: the repo's agent is killed and the app launched with
# --session-persistence=false, so a restored manifest cannot hand this run a
# previous run's panes.

    # L2b. Shift+Tab walks the SAME ring backwards (T569). That is the one-step

    # - and it is decided by handleKey reading GetKeyState(VK_SHIFT), which is
    # why it needed ESTABLISHING before it could be asserted: the harness fakes
    # modifier state with SetKeyboardState, a mechanism this repo has already
    # recorded as unreliable for a GetKeyState read in another process.
    #
    # Send-TestControlKey is the helper that cannot carry it, and says so in its
    # own doc comment: it pokes the worker thread's key-state table and nothing
    # shares that table with the app. So the chord goes through Send-TestKeys,
    # which ATTACHES the two input queues first (AttachThreadInput) and is the
    # same path every terminal chord in this suite already takes.
    #
    # BOTH halves of that were measured on the box, 2026-09-05, and this is the
    # evidence T569 asked for rather than a preference: through Send-TestKeys
    # all four steps below land on the backwards neighbour, and the same four
    # steps re-run through Send-TestControlKey -Modifiers shift land on the
    # FORWARD one ("focus landed on Show all - the Shift never reached the app").
    # So the mechanism is the attachment, and the product's backwards walk is
    # not in question.
    #
    # And the failure is self-diagnosing, which is what makes this an assertion
    # rather than a recorded limit. nextFocus's backwards cycle is unit tested,
    # so a Shift the app never saw does not land focus somewhere random - it
    # lands on the FORWARD neighbour. Each step below names that neighbour, so a
    # red line says which half broke: the forward stop means the modifier was
    # lost in the harness, anything else means the walk itself is wrong.

    # the pid onto a bystander between the two clicks.
