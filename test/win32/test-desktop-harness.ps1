# T211 acceptance: the shared test-desktop harness itself.
#
# test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1 is what every other GUI acceptance script is
# about to depend on (T212/T213), so it needs its own coverage: a harness that
# silently stops delivering input or silently captures a blank bitmap would
# turn the whole suite green for the wrong reason.
#
# Each mechanism the harness replaces is exercised end-to-end against a real
# ghoztty on a background desktop, and asserted by OUTCOME read back over IPC
# or from the window tree - never by "the call returned true":
#
#   desktop     the window exists on the test desktop and is NOT enumerable on
#               the interactive one, and nothing we launch ever takes
#               foreground there (the user's actual complaint).
#   coords      both Get-TestWindowRect forms are SCREEN space - including
#               -Client, which picks the client RECTANGLE and still returns it
#               positioned on screen - and it is the same space the input
#               takes. T327 (2026-08-20): that was the unwritten assumption
#               under every click in the suite, stated only inside the C#
#               body. Parked off the screen origin with a negative control,
#               so a 0,0-based rect would turn it red.
#   focus       Focus-TestWindow, which replaces the T86 GrabForeground that
#               cannot work off the input desktop.
#   activation  (T568) Set-TestActiveWindow / Clear-TestActiveWindow - the WRITE
#               side of activation, which the harness had no form of at all: it
#               could read who was active but never move it, so "chrome X shows
#               only while this window has the keyboard" was assertable in one
#               direction only. Both shapes are exercised - nobody holding it
#               (focus really reads back 0) and a sibling top-level holding it -
#               and both are read off the input queue, never off a return value.
#   text        Send-TestText into a terminal -> the characters appear in
#               +read, exactly once (posting WM_CHAR as well as WM_KEYDOWN
#               doubles every character; the T207 spike hit that).
#   chords      Send-TestKeys ctrl+shift+t -> a second tab in +list.
#   controls    Send-TestControlText/Key into the rename dialog's EDIT, which
#               is the OPPOSITE convention (standard controls need WM_CHAR,
#               and nothing translates a posted message) -> the window title
#               changes.
#   capture     Get-TestWindowPixels via PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT),
#               the only capture that survives off the input desktop.
#   limit       and where that capture STOPS: the GhozttyTerminal surface.
#               T214 (2026-08-01) turned the header's prose into three
#               measured assertions - the guard refuses it by class, the
#               forced capture is a flat fill, and the fill does not move when
#               the pane renders. The last two are the negative control for
#               the first: without them the refusal is a superstition.
#               T275 (2026-08-11) added a fourth, and it is a PAIR with those:
#               route 0 (`capture-pane`, the app reading back its own
#               renderer) captures the SAME pane at the SAME moment and sees
#               the text. The limit is unrepealed; what changed is that there
#               is now somewhere to send a probe that hits it.
#               T303 (2026-08-20) widened the guard past the one class it knew:
#               PrintWindow sees GDI, not composition, so EVERY WinUI/XAML
#               window (Task Manager measured flat black 1379x1134, 1 color,
#               reported success) captures as nothing. Three more assertions -
#               the bitmap-level refusal fires on a known-flat surface, its
#               message names the cause and the opt-out, and real chrome still
#               sails through, which is the half that keeps a stricter guard
#               from being a broken one.
#
# `-NegativeControl` inverts the three T303 assertions and the class refusal
# beside them; that run must FAIL. Without it the guards are a superstition -
# an assertion that cannot be made to fail proves nothing about the code it
# claims to cover.
#
# The capture assertion carries its own negative control: the SAME probe runs
# against a light-chrome window and a dark-chrome one and must separate them.
# A blank or stale bitmap cannot pass both.
#
# T213 (2026-08-01): that control used to flip `--window-theme=light|dark`,
# and it stopped separating anything. Since T254/T205 the caption band is
# CLIENT-painted by us and derives from `background` (+20 per channel), not
# from the DWM caption `window-theme` used to restyle - so both halves read the
# SAME meanLum 65-71. Note how it failed: the light half went red while the
# dark half stayed GREEN on the identical pixels, because 71 satisfies "< 100".
# A two-sided control is only a control if both sides are asserted against the
# separation, so the halves now assert the gap between them as well.
# Whether `window-theme` SHOULD still reach the caption is a product question,
# filed as T273 - not something this harness gets to decide by measuring.
