# T1058 acceptance - the ship workflow: the cutover readiness gate and the
# per-feature worktree/branch/PR lifecycle.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\ship-workflow.ps1
#
# Non-interactive. Launches no Ghoztty and touches no user state: the subjects
# are two git/gh-driving scripts, so the lifecycle half runs entirely inside a
# throwaway repo pair under $env:TEMP, and the readiness half only READS this
# repo.
#
# isolation: none - no ghoztty binary is run and no CLI verb is invoked; the
# only executables this script starts are git and (read-only, section C) gh.
# (T680 meta-check reads this marker.)
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#
# Both subjects are gates, and a gate that is wrong is worse than no gate: one
# says "this branch is ready to become the trunk" and the other deletes
# worktrees and branches. Every section below is an assertion that a REFUSAL
# actually refuses, because that is the half that cannot be checked by using the
# tool - a script that has quietly stopped refusing looks exactly like one that
# had nothing to refuse.
#
# A - ship-readiness reports honestly. An unmeasured criterion is UNKNOWN and
#     counts against readiness; the numbers it prints are the numbers git gives;
#     it never mutates the repo it judges; and a criterion that fails carries a
#     remedy, because a gate with no exit is a gate people route around.
# B - the feature lifecycle, end to end, in a sandbox: new / list / pr / done,
#     including every refusal (duplicate slug, bad slug, dirty tree, nothing to
#     propose, unpushed commits, missing worktree).
# C - the gh landmine. This repo has upstream (ghostty-org/ghostty) as a remote
#     and gh resolves to it by default, so a bare `gh pr create` here would
#     offer this fork's work to the public Ghostty project. Every gh call in the
#     family must name --repo, and this section is what keeps that true.
# D - the docs are wired: the workflow doc exists and covers the lifecycle, and
#     go.md reaches both scripts, so a turn following only go.md can execute one.
