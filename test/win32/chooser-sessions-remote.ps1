# Machine-chooser session roster against a REMOTE machine (tracker T319).
#
# T318 gave the chooser's detail pane a session roster for the LOCAL agent. This
# is the same roster pointed at another machine: selecting a relay device dials
# it, runs LIST_SESSIONS over that connection, and shows ITS sessions. There is
# no new RPC on that path - `Connection.requestSessions` is transport-agnostic -
# so what this script is about is the DIAL, its ownership, and the per-row
# states that dial can resolve to.
#
# THE FIXTURE. `lib\FakeRelay.ps1` stands up a loopback relay that serves the
# device directory AND bridges `ws://.../v1/client/connect` to a real
# `ghoztty-agent --listen 127.0.0.1:<port>`. That agent is the "other machine".
# Two remote windows are opened through the relay, so it really has sessions.
#
# WHY THE COUNT DISCRIMINATES. The app runs with `--session-persistence=false`
# and every repo agent is killed first, so THIS box has no local agent at all:
# the Local row must resolve to `failed`, and the device row to a roster of 2.
# A roster that quietly enumerated the local machine would show the same number
# on both rows - the failure mode T295 named and refused to ship. The relay's
# own request log is the independent witness that the bytes went through it.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   A  the app lists devices through our relay (setup control)
#   B  Local resolves to `failed` - there is no local agent to list
#   C  the device row loads the REMOTE agent's 2 sessions, tagged with the
#      device id it loaded them from
#   D  the relay saw a /v1/client/connect for that device (independent)
#   E  the count TRACKS the agent: close one remote window, come back, 1 left
#   F  an expired credential resolves to `unauthorized`, not "couldn't reach"
#   G  an unreachable machine resolves to `failed` (the mandatory negative
#      control: a row pointed at a machine that answers 502)
#   H  ... and the dialog is still alive after both failures - it repaints,
#      re-fetches the Local row, and Escape still closes it
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL. `-NegativeControl` makes the relay refuse `dev-remote` too,
# and inverts C: the roster must NOT load. Without it, "the remote roster
# loaded" could ride on any roster loading at all.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop and never takes the user's
# foreground. T248: the repo's agent and app are killed at setup and the app is
# launched with persistence off, so no previous run's panes can be measured.
