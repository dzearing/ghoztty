# pty-host acceptance (T904): the per-session ConPTY holder process.
#
# Sections:
#   A. End-to-end smoke: `ghoztty-agent --pty-host-smoke` spawns REAL holder
#      processes and drives them over the real control pipe. Its checks (all
#      asserted here individually off its stdout): HELLO fields, output flow,
#      RESIZE reaching the shell (`mode con` reports the new width), owner
#      death leaving the shell alive, reconnect gap-replay with contiguous
#      offsets, EXIT carrying the shell's exit code, the holder finishing
#      after delivery, and a killed holder's Job Object taking the shell
#      subtree with it. Since T905 it also drives the PRODUCTION owner client
#      (`pty_holder_child.open`, the one the agent uses) through the
#      `session.Child` vtable: output to the sink, the spawn spec's forwarded
#      `OPEN.env` reaching the shell, resize, the exit code via `tryWait`, and
#      a terminate that leaves neither shell nor holder behind. Since T970, an
#      owner that never releases what it took is flooded past a 4 KB ring, and
#      the drop must be logged by the holder and totalled in the next HELLO.
#   B. Pipe security: a live holder's control pipe carries an owner-only DACL
#      - every access rule on it names the current user, nobody else.
#
# The smoke's holder pipe names are read back from its own log (section A) so
# section B derives the real `[-debug]` segment instead of assuming the build
# mode. Holders use per-PID session ids and the agent's `--pty-host` mode only
# - no GUI is launched, no user endpoint is shared, and only processes spawned
# by this run are touched.
#
# The agent is a GUI-subsystem binary: launched via Start-Process with
# redirected streams (PowerShell would not wait for it otherwise), gated on
# its OUTPUT (the verdict line), not its exit code.
