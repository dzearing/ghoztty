# T1464 acceptance: is a pane SLOWER when its ConPTY is held by the agent?

#
# THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS. T1463 measured, on an optimized build, the same
# 9.4 MB workload through three terminals on this box:
#
#     conhost                                  7,950 / 8,468 / 7,956 ms
#     Ghoztty pane, LOCAL ConPTY (Exec.zig)    6,511 / 6,138 ms
#     Ghoztty pane, AGENT-held (Remote.zig)   12,863 / 12,706 ms
#
# The same build, the same workload, 2.1x slower when the PTY is held by
# `ghoztty-agent` - and the agent-held one is the configuration we ship. The
# parse cost was identical in both (~41 ms of every second), so the deficit was
# the RELAY: the trip from the holder's ConPTY read, across two named pipes, to
# the app's parser, which was carrying the stream ~60 bytes at a time at
# 10,000-22,600 messages a second.
#
# That contrast is the entire finding, and until this script it existed once, by
# hand, in a scratchpad. What is regressed here is the RATIO rather than any
# absolute time: the ratio is what named the defect, and unlike a millisecond
# count it means the same thing on a Debug build, on a loaded box, and on
# somebody else's hardware.
#
# Sections:
#   A. Local-ConPTY pane (`--session-persistence=false`, termio.Exec) - the
#      control, the same app doing the same work with no relay in the path.
#   B. Agent-held pane (`--session-persistence=true`, termio.Remote) - the
#      shipped configuration.
#   C. The contrast: B is not materially slower than A.
#   D. conhost, for context. Reported, and asserted only as a sanity floor -
#      the box is not the variable this script controls.
#   E. The run stayed off the interactive desktop.
#
# -NegativeControl makes every timing arm wait for a stamp file the workload
# never writes, so each measured arm must go RED while the setup arms stay
# green. That is the proof the arms score ARRIVAL rather than the clock.
#
# READ THE RATIO ON AN OPTIMIZED BUILD. Against the default Debug `zig-out` the
# contrast INVERTS - measured 0.20x, agent-held 10.3 s against local 50.9 s -
# and that is not a relay win. Debug's parser is ~150x slower per byte (T1463),
# so a local pane back-pressures its child down to its own parse rate while the
# agent's ring absorbs the whole burst and lets the child run on. The same run
# shows it: `holder_read` still delivers 10,671 chunks a second while every leg
# downstream carries 2 frames a second of 32 KB, i.e. the writer coalescing this
# task added working exactly as designed against a consumer that is genuinely
# behind. Section C is still worth running on Debug - it is a liveness and
# correctness check on both paths - but the NUMBER only means something under
# `-ReleaseSandbox`.
#
# Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1): every oracle is a
# CLI round trip or a file the child stamps, both desktop-independent.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out.

# immediately before T1465. T1465 found the cause - the holder's process tree
# was being placed on the CPU's efficiency cores, where the shell->conhost round
# trip behind every ~73-byte chunk of output costs ~122 us against ~55 us on a
# performance core - and took the plumbing off them: three runs at 1.51x, 1.56x,
# 1.58x. Hence 1.75: above every measurement of the fixed path, below every
# measurement of the broken one, so this arm now fails if the fix stops working
