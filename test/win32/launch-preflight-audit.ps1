# T1033 meta-check: a test\win32 script that LAUNCHES the app must run the
# build-mode pre-flight first - as a CHECKED property, not a remembered rule.
#
# Why: `Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild` (lib\BuildMode.ps1) is the only thing that
# stops an acceptance run driving the terminal the user is sitting in. A
# zig-out built without `-Doptimize=Debug` derives the SAME app pipe, agent
# pipe and state directory as their installed release, so every `+new-window`
# opens a window in their session, every kill matches nothing, and the script
# passes while measuring a binary nobody here built (T350 has the field
# report). 51 scripts asked the question. banner-resize-repaint.ps1 launched
# the app without asking, and nothing enumerated who else did - which is the
# hole this scan closes.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS LAUNCHING THE APP, for a text scan: `Start-Process` on a path
# or variable that this script itself binds to a `ghoztty.exe`. Deliberately
# NOT covered:
#
#   * `Start-OnTestDesktop` - since T1033 the helper runs the pre-flight itself
#     for any exe named ghoztty.exe, which is how ~80 GUI scripts get it. That
#     seam is not assumed either: section B EXERCISES it against stub exes, so
#     a refactor that drops the assert fails here rather than years later.
#   * `ghoztty-agent.exe` launches. The agent's endpoints are build-mode
#     derived too, but its exe prints a build STAMP rather than a mode, so
#     `Get-GhozttyBuildMode` cannot read it and this assert cannot speak for
#     it. Tracked separately (T1036); flagging it here would only teach people
#     to add a claim that checks the wrong binary.
#   * `+verb` CLI calls with no process launch - that is isolation-meta.ps1's
#     property (a private endpoint), which is a different question about the
#     same run.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS ASKING: a call to any function that reaches the gate -
# `Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild` itself, `Reset-GhozttyTestState` (CleanSlate)
# or `Assert-GhozttyPrivateEndpoint` (Isolation) - or an explicit, reviewable
# `# preflight: none - <why>` for a script that launches something the gate
# genuinely cannot vouch for.
#
# Like isolation-meta.ps1 this is a PRESENCE check by design: an execution-order
# check would have to trace PowerShell, and presence catches the class that
# burned us - nobody asked at all - without ever crying wolf. Section A proves
# the scan still bites on synthetic fixtures, so a green run here means the
# scanner works AND the tree is clean.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\launch-preflight-audit.ps1
#
# Non-interactive; launches nothing real. The release cases are played by stub
# exes that print a `+version` banner, the same trick build-mode-guard.ps1 uses.
#
# isolation: none - every CLI verb in this file is prose or fixture text, and
# the only exe ever run is a stub .cmd in $env:TEMP that echoes a banner. There
# is no endpoint to make private.
