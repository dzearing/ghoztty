# T295 acceptance: the Activity Monitor panel against a REMOTE source.
#
# T285 built the panel on the LOCAL source and T295 gives it a connection. Two
# of Mac's three entry styles differ only in WHO OWNS that connection
# (RemoteActivityMonitor.swift:8-16), and ownership is the thing that can go
# quietly wrong, so it is what this script is about:
#
#   A. a remote WINDOW's palette opens a panel titled for the MACHINE, not
#      "Activity - Local";
#   B. the rows come from the AGENT, not from this process;
#   C. the registry still focuses rather than duplicates, across the remote
#      source;
#   D. closing that panel LEAVES THE REMOTE WINDOW'S SESSION ALIVE - the panel
#      borrowed the window's connection and must never free it.
#
# T296 adds the switcher to the same fixture, because a carousel needs a second
# source and this script is where one exists:
#
#   E. the machine-card carousel moves the panel to another source IN PLACE -
#      one click, no second window, retitled, sampling the new machine - while
#      ARROWING dials nothing, and switching away from a BORROWED connection
#      leaves the window's session alive exactly as closing does.
#
# T300 adds the other way in, for the same reason - a carousel needs a second
# source to be reachable at all:
#
#   F. the carousel is reachable BY KEYBOARD from a cold open: Tab alone walks
#      to it with no mouse click anywhere in the panel, Left/Right/Home/End
#      then move the ring without dialing, and Return commits the switch -
#      while a focused BUTTON still owns Space, which is why the pre-T300 gate
#      could not simply be deleted.
#
# T298 puts a LIVE readout on the cards the panel is not showing, which is the
# half of Mac's MachineMetricsProbe T296 deliberately deferred:
#
#   H. an INACTIVE card carries live numbers, not the directory's online flag -
#      the Local card from a plain local sampler, a machine card from a PROBE
#      that dialed its OWN connection - while the ACTIVE machine gets no probe
#      at all, and closing the panel hands every probe connection back without
#      touching the window's. (The refused-dial half needs a machine with a
#      card and no listener, which this fixture cannot make; it lives in
#      `activity-monitor-probe-fail.ps1`.)
#
# T301 closes the round trip E only half made:
#
#   G. switching BACK to a machine a live WINDOW is connected to keeps that
#      machine's CARD reachable and BORROWS the window's connection instead of
#      re-dialing one - and when that window closes underneath, the panel is
#      told to let go rather than reading freed memory, the APP SURVIVES the
#      close (T613), and the panel stays open.
#
# T614 uses the same borrow, one state further on:
#
#   J. when the borrowed-from WINDOW reconnects - its agent died and came back,
#      so the swap retires the transport the panel is holding - the panel
#      FOLLOWS the window onto the new one and resumes sampling on its own, with
#      no reopen. The oracle is the NEW agent's root pid; a panel left on the
#      retired transport cannot produce it, and one that re-dialed its way back
#      fails the dial count beside it.
#
# WHY B NEEDS AN ORACLE AT ALL. The loopback agent enumerates the same box, so
# "the table populated" proves nothing: a panel that silently sampled THIS
# process would produce an identical-looking table under another machine's
# name, which is exactly the lie T295's predecessor refused to tell. The
# distinguishing field is the snapshot's ROOT PID: the agent's own pid for a
# remote sample (PROC_SNAPSHOT.agent_pid), this app's for a local one. It is
# logged by `ActivityMonitor.rebuild` as `root=`, alongside the counts the
# painter walks - a derivation of the painted state, not a restatement of the
# assertion.
#
# CONTROLS. Two positive controls run before any verdict: ctrl+shift+p must
# open the palette (else the injection is broken, not the product), and the
# remote pane must round-trip through the agent (else the link is broken).
# `-NegativeControl` inverts B - it asserts the root pid is the APP's, i.e.
# that the panel sampled locally - and that run MUST fail.
#
# NOT COVERED HERE: the DIALED entry (the chooser's Activity button), which is
# the other half of the ownership question this script is about - it OWNS what
# it opens, where every panel here BORROWS. That used to be uncoverable on box
# (a relay device needs a signed-in account and a real relay), and it is not
# any more: `lib\FakeRelay.ps1` bridges a loopback relay to a real agent, so
# `activity-monitor-dialed.ps1` drives dial -> sample -> free end to end,
# including a panel closed with its dial still in flight and - the mirror image
# of D below - a panel that must free its OWN connection while a window on the
# same machine keeps its session (T297, T329). `chooser-menu.ps1` still owns the
# button itself and its honest failure against a directory that is no agent.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop and asserts at the end that it
# never took the user's foreground.
# T248: the repo's agent is killed and the app launched with
# --session-persistence=false, so a restored manifest cannot hand this run a
# previous run's panes.
