# ChromeGeometry.ps1 - the ONE place an acceptance script learns where the
# win32 chrome is.
#
# Why this file exists (T257). Twice now, one chrome change in one place broke
# a pile of acceptance scripts that each re-derived the same numbers privately:
#
#   * T254 moved the tab strip off client `y = 0` (the caption band became
#     CLIENT area). Cost: 7 failures in tab-strip.ps1, 19 in menu-bar.ps1.
#   * T235 changed what SIZES a tab. Cost: 4 more in menu-bar.ps1 alone.
#
# In both cases the app-side change was one number in one module. The scripts
# were expensive because four of them - tab-strip.ps1, menu-bar.ps1,
# tab-strip-autohide.ps1, tab-color.ps1 - each kept their own copy of the
# caption height, the strip height, the strip's origin, and the right-anchored
# button band. Same measurement, four implementations, four chances to be
# wrong, and they were not even consistent with each other (see ROUNDING).
#
# T205 moved this datum a THIRD time - the tab strip went INTO the caption row -
# and this file was the edit, exactly as predicted. Total cost to the scripts:
# one new argument each (`-StripVisible`), because the datum was in one place.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MERGED vs STANDALONE (T205) - and why -StripVisible is REQUIRED, not guessed
#
# A window that owns its caption now has TWO possible chrome shapes:
#
#   * MERGED (2+ tabs, or --window-show-tab-bar=always): one row. The band is
#     the STRIP's height (40 DIP), the strip starts at client y = 0, there is
#     no window title, and the tab run stops at a seam one `pad_md` left of the
#     caption's "...". Total chrome above the terminal: 40 DIP.
#   * STANDALONE (one tab, the T234 default): no strip at all. The band is the
#     native 32 DIP Win11 caption height (T496) with the window title in it.
#     Total chrome: 32 DIP.
#
# Those two disagree about the y of EVERY strip pixel and about where the "+"
# may sit, so the helper cannot pick one. It also cannot detect which it is
# looking at: the deciding input is the window's tab COUNT, which lives in the
# app and is not on the HWND. So the caller - which knows what it launched -
# must say, and a caller that does not say gets a throw rather than a plausible
# wrong offset. T259 is the reason that is not negotiable: a script that
# silently modelled the wrong chrome measured last year's geometry and passed.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PUBLISHED vs DERIVED vs MEASURED - the line this file draws, and why
#
# Three ways to learn where a thing is, in descending order of preference:
#
#   * PUBLISHED (`Get-TestStripRegions`, T231). The app REPORTS the tab strip's
#     hit regions in `+list --json`, in client coordinates, and they are the
#     very rects its hit tests read. **Ask for a click target this way.** It
#     cannot rot, because there is no second copy of the layout to rot against.
#   * DERIVED - a DIP constant resolved the way the Zig modules resolve it
#     (`caption_layout.Metrics`, `tab_strip_layout.Metrics`,
#     `icon_button.Metrics`). A script can restate those exactly, and where it
#     does, a disagreement with the app is a real failure the script must be
#     able to see. Keep this for CONSTANTS (a 4 DIP step, the 28 DIP square),
#     never for a position that depends on the tab run.
#   * MEASURED off a capture (`Get-TestTabExtents`). This is the only one that
#     can prove something is PAINTED, so it stays - but it answers "where is
#     there ink", not "where will a click land", and using it for the latter is
#     what T256/T259 cost.
#
# What forced the split: a tab's WIDTH is not derivable. Since T235 it is the
# measured title plus padding (capped at 50% of the run), so it comes out of
# text metrics a PowerShell script cannot reproduce. T256 learned that the
# expensive way - menu-bar.ps1 modelled "equal share capped at 200 DIP", got
# ~250px against a real ~344px tab, and clicked the "+" inside tab 1. The
# answer then was to MEASURE the run; T231 made the product publish it, which
# is better still: exact, available before the window has a stable capture, and
# unambiguous about what is absent (a tab that did not fit reports `null`, and
# a pixel scan cannot tell that from a tab that painted nothing).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ROUNDING - the trap that made the private copies disagree
#
# The layout modules round with Zig's `@round`, which is round-half-AWAY-from-
# zero. PowerShell's `[math]::Round($x)` is BANKER'S rounding (half to even).
# They agree at 100%, 125%, 150% and 200% because nothing lands on .5 there -
# which is exactly why the divergence went unnoticed - and disagree at 112.5%
# DPI, where `4 * 1.125 = 4.5` becomes 4 in PowerShell and 5 in the app.
#
# menu-bar.ps1 got this right (it passed MidpointRounding::AwayFromZero);
# tab-strip.ps1 and tab-color.ps1 did not. `Get-TestChromeDip` below is the
# one rounding, and it matches the app.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Source of truth for every constant below, verified against the Zig:
#
#   icon_button.Metrics.init      target   = px(28)   hit_pad = px(2)
#   caption_layout.Metrics.init   caption_h = px(32) standalone (native, T496)
#                                 cap_btn_w = px(46) - one native system slab
#   tab_strip_layout.Metrics.init bar_h     = px(4) + px(4) + target + px(4)
#                                 strip_pad_l = strip_pad_r = tab_gap = px(4)
#                                 group_gap = px(8)   min_tab_w = px(60)
#                                 stripe_h  = max(px(3), 2)
#                                 hairline  = max(px(1), 1)
#   tab_strip_layout.runWidth     client_w - pad_r - btn - gap - btn - gap - pad_l
#                                 ...MINUS the "= " square and one gap only when
#                                 the strip HAS a menu button (T260: it does not
#                                 when the caption's "..." hosts the menu)
#   tab_strip_layout.tabCap       max(runWidth / 2, min_tab_w)

# The layout modules' `px()`: `@intFromFloat(@round(dip * scale))`. Zig's
# `@round` is half-away-from-zero, NOT PowerShell's default banker's rounding.
# Every DIP constant in this file goes through here.

Where the win32 chrome is, for one window, at its own DPI.

All DIP constants are resolved the way the layout modules resolve them, so a
script that uses these cannot drift from the app by rounding or by restating a
constant slightly wrong.

Coordinate spaces are named, because mixing them is how a click ends up in the
caption (where it drags the window or hits close):

  * `*Client`  - client-relative, what Get-TestWindowRect -Client is in.
  * `StripTop` - WINDOW-relative y of the strip's first row, which is what a
                 Get-TestWindowPixels bitmap is indexed by. `OffX`/`OffY` are
                 the client origin inside that bitmap, so a client x maps to
                 `OffX + x`.

Returns a pscustomobject; unknown members are a typo, not a silent $null, so
prefer reading them straight rather than splatting.

<#
The tab strip's hit regions as the APP publishes them (T231), in CLIENT
coordinates - `+list --json` -> `windows[].chrome.tab_strip`.

This is the answer to "where do I click", and it is the app's own rects rather
than a second implementation of `tab_strip_layout.layout()` in PowerShell. The
re-implementation it replaced rotted twice (a fixed 46px offset that landed
inside the menu button at 125% DPI; then a modelled tab width that stopped
matching when T235 sized tabs to their titles), each time producing failures
against a completely healthy product.

Returns $null when the window shows no tab strip. THROWS when the server does
not report chrome at all - that means a build older than T231, and answering
$null there would read as "this window has no strip", which is the exact
silent-wrong-model failure T259 is about.

Every rect carries Left/Top/Right/Bottom plus Width/Height/CenterX/CenterY, and
a region with nothing to hit is $null: the strip's "=" on a window whose
caption hosts the menu (T260), a tab the strip could not fit, and every region
of a strip that has not painted yet. Because of that last one this POLLS until
the "+" is reported (a strip always lays one out) or -TimeoutMs elapses, so a
caller never has to know that a freshly shown window reports empty regions for
a few frames.

  Band    - where the strip's content may sit: inside both insets, and the
            buttons' own vertical band. Its Right is the strip's right END,
            which on a merged caption row (T205) is the seam, not the window
            edge.
  Tabs    - one entry per tab, in tab order; $null where a tab did not fit.
  TabsRight - the last laid-out tab's right edge (Band.Left when there are none).
  NewTab  - the "+"'s hit box.
  Menu    - the "="'s hit box, or $null (T260).

<#
Every painted tab chiclet's extent, in CLIENT x, as an array of
`{ Left, Right, Center }` (Right exclusive) - MEASURED off a capture.

**Since T231 this is for assertions about the PAINT, not for click targets.**
`Get-TestStripRegions` reports the app's own tab rects exactly and needs no
capture; what this adds is the only thing a report cannot say - that something
was actually drawn there. Reach for it when "an inactive tab is visible against
the strip" is the claim, and for nothing else. A scan cannot tell a tab that
did not fit from one that painted nothing, and it is 1-2px generous either way
(chiclet antialiasing).

Scans a row near the strip's BOTTOM: inside a chiclet at its full width (the
chiclet's rounding is on the TOP corners only) and below the "+" glyph's
extent, so nothing between the last tab and the menu button can be mistaken
for one. Chiclets are the runs that are NOT strip background; the `tab_gap`
between two tabs is background, which is what separates them. The SELECTED
chiclet is a different shade from an unselected one and both differ from the
strip, so this finds every tab regardless of which is selected.

Deliberately generic about count and width: this is what lets a script click
tab N without knowing what the shell called it (T235 made a tab's width its
measured title, and T259 is what happens to a script that models it instead).

Returns an empty array when the strip has no tabs or the window never paints.
Always index it as `@(...)` - a single-element result unrolls in PowerShell.

Pass -Shot to reuse a capture you already have; otherwise one is taken (and
disposed) here with -Sync, so the window paints the frame itself before the
call returns (T941) rather than handing back whatever DWM had composited. The
retry loop stays because a window can be up before its tabs are: it now covers
content that is genuinely not there yet, not a capture that arrived early.

The last tab's painted right edge, in CLIENT x, exclusive - MEASURED, with the

Falls back to `PadL` (an empty run) when there are no tabs or the window never
captures with real content, which is what a strip with no tabs measures - the

Thickness of the top resize band in physical px, exactly as
`caption_layout.resizeBorder` derives it: the window-DPI
`SM_CYSIZEFRAME + SM_CXPADDEDBORDER`, clamped to half the band, floor 1.
`-PadSm` is the 4 DIP step (the module's fallback for a 0/negative metric).

T266 measured the reference (live WindowsTerminal.exe 1.24, 2026-08-06, 125%):
over a TAB, WT's island child answers HTCLIENT from the very top row — a tab
is never a resize target — while WT's drag-bar child gives the EMPTY band an
HTTOP edge. `chrome-merged-row` §4 therefore asserts HTCLIENT at a tab's top
and uses this count for the boundary probes over the empty band, where we keep
the full stock-frame metric.
