# ForegroundAudit (T272) - find the acceptance scripts that can still take the
# user's foreground, and keep the interactive-by-design exceptions DECLARED.
#
# T211-T218 moved the GUI suite onto a background desktop (`lib\TestDesktop.ps1`)
# because the user's complaint was that a test run kept stealing their focus.
# T217 closed at 23 of 23 and T218 at 13 of 13, and the fleet-wide claim became
# "the acceptance scripts no longer steal the user's foreground". A later sweep
# found two scripts (`overlay-zorder.ps1`, `split-dim.ps1`) in neither bucket,
# still grabbing - nothing had counted the remainder, so nothing said so. They
# were migrated by T224/T225; this file is what stops the property regrowing.
#
# THE RULE (widened by T276):
#
#     A script under `test\win32\` that can only run on the INPUT DESKTOP must
#     be DECLARED as interactive-by-design in `lib\TestDesktop.ps1`'s header.
#     An undeclared site is a miss.
#
# Being un-runnable in the loop is the property that matters; stealing focus is
# one cause of it, not the definition of it. T272 wrote the rule as "takes the
# foreground" and its sweep therefore could not see `color-contrast.ps1`, which
# calls neither `SendInput` nor `SetForegroundWindow` and was nonetheless
# input-desktop-only: it read the COMPOSITED SCREEN with `GetDC(NULL)` +
# `GetPixel`, and DWM composes only the input desktop. `split-dim.ps1` used the
# same mechanism and made T272's list only because it ALSO grabbed foreground -
# luck, not coverage. So two families of site count, and they share one
# declaration list because they are one exemption:
#
#   * INJECTION / FOREGROUND  - `Get-ForegroundAuditApis`.
#   * SCREEN-DC PROBES        - `Get-ForegroundAuditScreenDcApis`: a read of the
#                               composited screen rather than of a named window
#                               (`CopyFromScreen`, `GetDC`/`GetWindowDC`/
#                               `Graphics.FromHwnd` on a NULL or desktop hwnd).
#
# WHERE A PROBE READS IS NOT WHAT IT READS (the classification rule T225
# measured). `split-dim`'s probe was carried as a terminal-content probe by
# three task files because it sampled a point that lay OVER the terminal; what
# it actually sampled was a layered window in front of it. The question is
# always which window's painter owns those pixels - and a screen DC is exactly
# the mechanism that makes that unanswerable by inspection, because a window
# capture names its target while a screen DC names a point. That is the second
# reason to flag one, beyond the desktop it needs.
#
# What the screen-DC detector cannot see, stated rather than implied: a null
# handle that arrives through a VARIABLE (`$screen = [IntPtr]::Zero;
# GetDC($screen)`) is invisible to a textual rule, as is a P/Invoke declaration
# whose parameter is only ever filled at runtime. The literal call sites are
# what every screen probe in this suite has ever used, and the teeth check
# plants one of those.
#
# It also cannot see the difference between a call and a STRING that spells one,
# and that is not fixable by excluding string tokens: the P/Invoke declarations
# this whole check exists to find live inside `Add-Type` here-strings, which are
# string tokens. A file whose subject is these APIs therefore carries the
# `# foreground-audit:` marker below rather than a narrower pattern.
#
# The declaration and the check are deliberately the same list: an exception
# nobody wrote down is indistinguishable from an oversight, which is exactly how
# those two scripts went quiet. The list lives in the harness header - where a
# reader meets the `-Interactive` escape hatch - and is PARSED from there rather
# than restated here, so the prose a human reads and the set the check enforces
# cannot drift apart.
#
# Declaration grammar, one entry per line, anywhere in `lib\TestDesktop.ps1`:
#
#     # @input-desktop-exception: <script>.ps1 -- <one-line reason>
#
# Three finding kinds, all of them the defect, all enforced at zero:
#
#   * `undeclared`            - a live grab site in a script that is not on the
#                               list. File the migration, or declare it.
#   * `stale-declaration`     - a declared script that no longer grabs (or no
#                               longer exists). A list naming scripts that do not
#                               need naming is how a real miss gets waved through.
#   * `malformed-declaration` - a marker line the parser could not read, or a
#                               header with no declarations at all. A list that
#                               silently evaporates would turn every violation
#                               into a pass.
#
# The declaration list is how an INTERACTIVE script is exempted, and it is the
# only way: a grab that is not on it is a finding, full stop. There is a second,
# narrower marker for a different thing - a file that NAMES these APIs without
# calling them:
#
#     # foreground-audit: <reason>
#
# the same state-your-intent convention the `# persistence:`, `# exitcode-audit:`,
# `# skip-audit:`, `# verdict-audit:` and `# asserted-nothing-audit:` markers
# use. Today it is carried by exactly one file, this rule's own acceptance
# script, whose fixtures are string literals holding the very P/Invokes it
# detects. It is NOT an alternative to declaring an interactive script: a marked
# file must still not take the foreground, and the reason has to say why it
# cannot.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A SITE. Live code only: a token that is not a PowerShell
# comment, and not a `//` or `/* */` comment inside an embedded C# here-string.
# Two thirds of the suite MENTIONS `SendInput` - in a header explaining that it
# is dead on a background desktop - and reading those as violations would push
# 22 innocent scripts onto the exception list, which is the same rot from the
# other direction. That is not hypothetical for the screen-DC family either:
# eleven scripts name `CopyFromScreen` in a header saying it is dead there, and
# exactly one calls it. Three shapes count:
#
#   1. One of the watched user32 entry points (`Get-ForegroundAuditApis`) in
#      live code, including inside an `Add-Type` here-string, which is where the
#      P/Invoke declarations actually live.
#   1b. A screen-DC read (`Get-ForegroundAuditScreenDcPattern`) in live code.
#      The NULL is load-bearing: `GetDC($hwnd)` is a window DC and is not a
#      finding, so a P/Invoke DECLARATION (`extern IntPtr GetDC(IntPtr hWnd)`)
#      never trips this - only a call site that names the screen does.
#   2. `New-TestDesktop -Interactive` hardcoded. The hatch skips the desktop
#      entirely and drives the app the old way; the header says it is "for
#      debugging by hand only ... never how an acceptance run is scored", and a
#      script that pins it on is a foreground grab with no P/Invoke in it.
#      `-Interactive:$Interactive` is the normal forwarding of a debug switch
#      and is not a finding.
#
# SCOPE: `test\win32\*.ps1` AND `test\win32\lib\*.ps1` (T780). It used to be the
# top level alone, on the grounds that `lib\` holds the harness itself and
# `TestDesktop.ps1` owns the interactive hatch and therefore a legitimate
# `SendInput`. That reasoning covers ONE file and was written as a directory
# exclusion, which is the same miss shape T272 and T276 each closed, one level
# up: a new `lib\` helper that read the composited screen would make EVERY
# script calling it input-desktop-only, and not one of them would be flagged,
# because the site would not be in a swept file. Measured 2026-08-11 and again
# when this widened: zero such helpers exist, so this closes the hole before it
# is used rather than after.
#
# A helper is not an acceptance script, so it is not exempted the same way. The
# declaration list answers "this SCRIPT can only run on the input desktop"; a
# helper that holds these APIs by design - the desktop harness's own hatch, the
# capability probe whose whole job is to ask whether `SendInput` is accepted
# here - is a different claim, and it carries its own one-line marker instead:
#
#     # input-desktop-helper: <reason>
#
# honoured only for a file under `lib\`, and only with a reason after it. The
# point is that the exemption is a line a reader can find, with a why on it,
# rather than a directory that was silently out of scope. A top-level
# acceptance script that carries the marker is still a finding - a helper
# marker is not a second way to declare a script - and a `lib\` file that
# carries one while grabbing nothing is a stale marker, for the same reason a
# stale declaration is: a list naming files that do not need naming is how a
# real miss gets waved through.
#
# A `lib\` helper that genuinely IS input-desktop-only can still be DECLARED,
# by its path: `@input-desktop-exception: lib\<name>.ps1 -- <reason>`. Files are
# keyed by their path relative to `test\win32`, so the two directories cannot
# be confused with each other.
#
# `scripts\` is out of scope on purpose, and the scope was measured rather than
# assumed: run over `scripts\*.ps1` + `scripts\lib\*.ps1` on 2026-08-11 this
# finds ZERO sites - re-measured the same day with the widened screen-DC family
# (29 files, still zero). Those are tools the user RUNS - a launcher that raises
# the window it just started is doing its job - so the rule "declare it or it is
# a miss" does not transfer, and widening the sweep would mean writing a second
# policy for a set that is currently empty.
#
# Acceptance: `test\win32\foreground-audit.ps1` (analyzer both directions, the
# live sweep, and a `-TeethCheck` that plants a real violator in the swept
# directory and requires the sweep to find it).

# foreground-audit: this file IS the watch list - every API it names lives in a
# string literal in `Get-ForegroundAuditApis` / `Get-ForegroundAuditScreenDcApis`
# and none of them is ever called. It launches nothing and takes no foreground.
# (It matched the marker already, off the grammar line above; stating it here
# makes the exemption deliberate rather than a side effect of documenting it.)

# Deliberately sets no StrictMode: this file is dot-sourced INTO suite scripts,
# and a mode set here would silently change how every one of them evaluates.

# The user32 entry points that take the input desktop. Injection and foreground
# theft both, because a script that only moves the cursor has still reached out
