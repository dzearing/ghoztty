# FakeRelay.ps1 - a loopback stand-in for the rendezvous relay (T319).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every relay-dialed surface in the app (the chooser's session
# roster, its Activity button, cross-machine resume) goes through
# `relay_dial.dial`, which opens `ws://<base>/v1/client/connect?device=<id>` and
# treats the WebSocket as a TRANSPARENT BYTE PIPE to the remote agent. Until
# this file there was no way to exercise that on box: `ipc-machine-chooser.ps1`
# fakes the device DIRECTORY (plain HTTP), which is enough to get a row into the
# list and nothing more, and `activity-monitor-remote.ps1` says so out loud -
# "the DIALED entry needs a relay device". So the remote half of those surfaces
# was reachable only by unit tests and reading.
#
# WHAT IT IS. One TcpListener, one single-threaded event loop, three behaviours:
#
#   GET /v1/client/devices        -> the directory JSON (what the chooser lists)
#   GET /v1/client/connect?device -> a real RFC 6455 upgrade, then a byte bridge
#                                    to a `ghoztty-agent --listen host:port`
#   anything else                 -> 404
#
# The loop is single-threaded ON PURPOSE: the directory GET and the WebSocket
# have to share ONE port (`relay_base` is one origin for both), and a job that
# blocks in `AcceptTcpClient` while a bridge is open would deadlock the surface
# under test. `Pending()` + `DataAvailable` polling keeps every connection
# serviced without a thread each.
#
# BRIDGING RULES. Client->server frames are masked (RFC 6455 requires it of a
# client) and are unmasked before their payload is written to the agent socket.
# Server->client frames are unmasked binary, one per read chunk - the framing
# does NOT have to match what the client sent, because the client's
# `readMessage` reassembles and the layer above it reads a STREAM. `ping` is
# answered, `close` tears the pair down.
#
# FAILURE INJECTION. A test needs the sad paths more than the happy one, so a
# device id is also a verb:
#
#   -UnauthorizedDevice <ids>  the upgrade answers 401 (an expired credential)
#   -UnreachableDevice <ids>   the upgrade answers 502 (the machine is offline)
#
# Both take a comma-separated list, so a negative-control run can add the
# otherwise-good device to one of them without a second parameter.
#
# Both are the NORMAL case in a chooser listing every enrolled device, and both
# must resolve to a state of the region rather than a modal.
#
# Three more are FILE-triggered, so a run can change the machine's behaviour
# part-way through - after a fixture has been built through it, or after a
# roster has loaded: `-TripFile` (502 from then on), `-TripUnauthorizedFile`
# (401 from then on) and `-SlowConnectFile` (every connect answered
# `-SlowConnectMs` late, deferred rather than slept on).
#
# Everything is loopback-only and lives in a background job; `Stop-FakeRelay`
# kills it. The request log is the independent evidence that a dial really went
# through the relay rather than some local shortcut.
