# DesktopCapability (T1100) - what the desktop a run happens on CAN DO, asked
# before the run instead of discovered as a red.
#
# input-desktop-helper: (T780) the `SendInput` below IS the measurement - a
# zero-delta mouse move whose only purpose is to learn whether this desktop
# accepts injected input, which is how `real-input` is answered. It moves
# nothing, clicks nothing, and a caller that asks the question is doing the
# opposite of becoming input-desktop-only: it is finding out before it assumes.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. The GUI acceptance scripts moved onto a
# background desktop (T211) so they stop stealing the user's foreground. A
# background desktop cannot capture composited pixels and cannot accept
# SendInput - both measured, both permanent (test-desktop-spike.ps1, and the
# CAPTURE LIMIT header in lib\TestDesktop.ps1). A script whose oracle needs one
# of those therefore fails THERE for a reason that has nothing to do with the
# product, and the T1094 sweep duly produced a cluster of reds that read exactly
# like defects:
#
#     SETUP FAIL (plain): could not take the foreground
#     Get-TestWindowPixels: the capture is UNIFORM - one color over its interior
#
# A permanently-red script teaches everyone to ignore the colour, which costs
# more than the assertion was ever worth. So a missing capability is reported as
# a SKIP with the capability named, and `scripts\suite-run.ps1` counts skips
# apart from failures - the suite's colour then means "the product is right",
# not "the box we ran on happened to be able to look".
#
# THE CAPABILITIES, and where each answer comes from:
#
#   chrome-pixels   The window's own GDI painting - title bar, tab strip, menus,
#                   dialog controls, banners. Available on BOTH desktops, via
#                   PrintWindow into a memory DC (`Get-TestWindowPixels -Sync`).
#                   Not via CopyFromScreen, which is `screen-pixels` below.
#   surface-pixels  Pixels of a COMPOSITED surface - the OpenGL terminal, any
#                   WinUI/XAML window. Unavailable on a background desktop: all
#                   three capture routes were measured there by T1115 and the
#                   surface reads 1-2 distinct colors against 102 on the
#                   interactive desktop. (Route 0 - asking the app for its own
#                   pane pixels over `capture-pane` IPC, lib\PaneCapture.ps1 -
#                   is NOT this capability: it needs no desktop at all and is
#                   the way around this limit rather than an instance of it.)
#   screen-pixels   CopyFromScreen / a screen DC. DWM composes only the input
#                   desktop; BitBlt off a background desktop's DC returns FALSE.
#   real-input      SendInput actually reaching a window. Blocked outright on a
#                   background desktop (0 of 12 events accepted, ACCESS_DENIED -
#                   asserted by test-desktop-spike.ps1's INPUT-1), and MEASURED
#                   on the interactive desktop, because an input lock can eat it
#                   there too (a fullscreen game overlay swallowing SendInput has
#                   already cost this suite a run of confident, wrong reds).
#   foreground      A window can be brought to the foreground. A background
#                   desktop has no foreground window at all (GetForegroundWindow
#                   returns 0); on the interactive desktop it is measured.
#   desktop-toasts  The shell draws a notification banner for a
#                   `Shell_NotifyIcon` balloon, so there is something on screen
#                   to click. A background desktop has no shell and no
#                   notification area, so NIM_ADD itself fails there; on the
#                   interactive desktop the user's master Notifications switch
#                   decides, and it is read from the registry. Measured off on
#                   this box on 2026-09-05 (T572) - see notification-click-real.ps1.
#
# HOW A SCRIPT USES IT. At the top, before it launches anything:
#
#     . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'lib\DesktopCapability.ps1')
#     Assert-TestDesktopCapability -Name real-input, foreground -Interactive
#
# which prints `SKIP ALL: real-input is not available here - <reason>` and
# exits 0 when the capability is missing, and is silent when it is present.
# `-Interactive` says the script drives the INPUT desktop (the declared
# interactive-by-design exceptions in lib\TestDesktop.ps1); without it the
# question is asked of the background test desktop, which is where the rest of
# the suite runs.
#
# For a capability that can only be discovered during setup - the foreground
# grab that returns false after the script is already running - there is
# `Exit-TestSkip`, which prints the same shape and exits 0:
#
#     if (-not (Grab-Foreground $hwnd)) {
#         Exit-TestSkip -Capability foreground -Reason 'an input lock owns the foreground'
#     }
#
# THE DEMONSTRATION THAT IT CAN FIRE. A capability check that has only ever said
# "available" is indistinguishable from one that cannot say anything else, so
# `GHOZTTY_TEST_FORCE_MISSING_CAPS=<name>[,<name>]` forces named capabilities
# unavailable. test-desktop-harness.ps1's capability section drives the skip
# path through it; nothing else may set it.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a way to quiet a script that fails for a real
# reason. A skip is legitimate only when the BOX cannot answer the question -
# never when the answer is inconvenient. The route table in lib\TestDesktop.ps1
# still comes first: a terminal-content probe re-expressed through route 0 or
# route 1 is worth more than a skipped one, and reaching for a skip before
# reading that table is how an assertion gets quietly deleted.

# Deliberately sets no StrictMode: dot-sourced INTO suite scripts, and a mode
# set here would silently change how every one of them evaluates.

Exit 0 on purpose: the script asserted nothing, and it did not fail. The verdict
