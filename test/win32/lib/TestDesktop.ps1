# T211: the shared test-desktop harness.
#
# Purpose: run the GUI acceptance scripts on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop
# (CreateDesktopW) so they stop stealing the user's foreground. The user's
# complaint, verbatim (2026-07-30): "you KEEP STEALING FOCUS USE ANOTHER
# DESKTOP for testing".
#
# Dot-source it:
#
#     . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'lib\TestDesktop.ps1')
#     $td   = New-TestDesktop
#     $app  = Start-OnTestDesktop -Exe $exe -Arguments @('--session-persistence=false')
#     $top  = Wait-TestWindow -ProcessId $app.Pid -Class 'GhozttyWindow'
#     $pane = Get-TestChildWindow -Window $top -Class 'GhozttyTerminal'
#     Send-TestKeys -Window $top -Target $pane -Modifiers ctrl,shift -Key T
#     Remove-TestDesktop
#
# A background desktop is NOT the input desktop, and that costs two of the
# mechanisms every existing script is built on. The T207 spike
# (test-desktop-spike.ps1) measured all of this on box; this file is where
# the replacements live so no script has to re-derive them:
#
#   SendInput            BLOCKED there (0 accepted, ACCESS_DENIED). Replaced by
#                        posted WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP with modifier state set via
#                        SetKeyboardState over an AttachThreadInput-shared input
#                        queue. Chords included.
#   SetForegroundWindow  Fails, and GetForegroundWindow returns 0 - a background
#                        desktop has no foreground window at all. Replaced by
#                        AttachThreadInput + SetActiveWindow + SetFocus, which is
#                        what the T86 GrabForeground helper becomes here.
#   CopyFromScreen       Dead (DWM composes only the input desktop; BitBlt off
#   / BitBlt             the desktop DC returns false). Replaced by
#                        PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT) - see the limit
#                        below, which is narrower than the spike concluded.
#
# CAPTURE TEAR (measured 2026-08-14, T835): PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT asks DWM for a
# copy of a layered window's composited surface, and that copy is ASYNCHRONOUS -
# it can hand back a half-finished frame. Three back-to-back captures of ONE
# banner overlay, unchanged and long since painted, put the right edge of the
# same table row at 1062, 1283 and 1179 px while the app logged an identical
# paint every time. So a pixel measurement over the default capture is a coin
# flip, and it fails in the direction that looks like a rendering bug in the
# app: pane-banner.ps1 went red about one run in three and T835 was filed
# against the banner's column math, which was never wrong.
# Use `Get-TestWindowPixels -Sync` for pixel ASSERTIONS on chrome. It goes
# through the window's own WM_PRINTCLIENT instead of DWM, so the window draws
# the frame synchronously into our DC and the bitmap is exactly what it painted
# (60/60 identical after the switch). It needs a WM_PRINTCLIENT handler in the
# window - add one, it is three lines beside the WM_PAINT case - and it throws
# rather than returning the blank frame a window without one prints.
#
# CAPTURE LIMIT (measured here 2026-07-30, and it REVISES T207's answer):
# PrintWindow on a background desktop returns the window's GDI-painted CHROME
# only - titlebar, tab strip, menus, dialog controls, banners. The OpenGL
# TERMINAL surface comes back as a flat fill: PrintWindow on a GhozttyTerminal
# child measured meanLum 255 / 1 distinct color, unchanged after typing, and a
# `--background=000000` window read the same 255 as a `--background=ffffff`
# one. The spike's "PrintWindow returns real content (64 distinct colors)"
# was reading the tab strip it had enabled, not the terminal. So: probes of
# native chrome migrate; probes of rendered terminal content cannot, and must
# not be "migrated" into an assertion that passes against a blank fill.
#
# THE GENERAL RULE (T303, 2026-08-20): PRINTWINDOW SEES GDI, NOT COMPOSITION.
# The terminal surface is one instance of it, not the extent of it. Anything
# that composites its pixels instead of painting them into the window DC comes
# back as a flat fill, and that covers every WinUI/XAML window - Settings, Task
# Manager, most of the Win11 shell. Measured: PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)
# on Task Manager's main window returned a flat black 1379x1134 bitmap, 1
# distinct color over a 7px grid, an 8 KB PNG, and reported SUCCESS; a
# vertical-seam scan over it found zero seams, which reads as "this app has no
# master-detail seam" rather than "there is no capture". The Win32 apps that DO
# capture are classic GDI dialogs. This is architectural and permanent, not a
# bug with a workaround.
#
# THE COROLLARY, for anyone reaching for a native reference: A WIN11 APP CANNOT
# BE USED AS A PIXEL REFERENCE AT ALL. A spec that needs Windows metrics
# measures them through SystemParametersInfoForDpi / GetSystemMetrics / uxtheme
# / DWM instead (what T302 did) and cites Fluent as DOCUMENTATION, never as a
# measurement. Second, smaller trap from the same probe: Task Manager launches
# elevated, so a non-elevated session cannot close it again - Stop-Process,
# CloseMainWindow and taskkill all return Access Denied. A fixture the harness
# cannot clean up is not a fixture.
#
# Get-TestWindowPixels enforces this half of the limit after the fact, since no
# class list could predict it: a non-trivial capture that is one color over its
# whole interior THROWS, after retrying long enough to rule out a window that
# simply had not painted yet. -AllowUniform opts out, for measuring the limit.
#
# THE ROUTE for a terminal-content probe (T214, decided 2026-08-01; route 0
# added by T275, 2026-08-11). In order, and the first one that applies wins:
#
#   0. ASK THE APP FOR ITS OWN PIXELS - `lib\PaneCapture.ps1`'s
#      Get-TestPaneCapture, over the debug-only `capture-pane` IPC action. The
#      pane's renderer thread reads back its OFFSCREEN target (the same
#      readback hero mode's thumbnails use) and the app writes a PNG, so no
#      desktop, no composite and no window visibility is involved - a HIDDEN
#      pane captures exactly as a focused one does (asserted in
#      pane-capture.ps1 section 5). This is the route for anything whose claim
#      really is "what the glass is showing": the tint that reached the GL
#      clear color, a pane that is rendering content at all.
#      Its own trap, and why it is route 0 rather than the only route: it
#      captures ONE PANE, not a composite, so it can say nothing about z-order,
#      chrome over glass, or a divider between two panes. For those, keep going.
#   1. ASK WHICH THREAD PAINTED THE PIXELS, not which technology produced
#      them. GL content that the app itself moves onto the GDI side is
#      capturable: the hero carousel's thumbnails are renderer output, but the
#      renderer thread snapshots them into a DIB (Surface.heroSnap*) and the
#      GUI thread blits them into the PARENT's DC inside BeginPaint, so
#      PrintWindow sees them (101 distinct colors, measured). Probe the window
#      that PAINTED, not the surface that RENDERED.
#   2. FIND ANOTHER NATIVE PAINTER OF THE SAME VALUE. window-color's pane
#      centre tint probe became the banner band, a different consumer of the
#      same effective background (Surface.refreshBannerColors). Label what the
#      substitute does NOT cover - there, the glass itself. (That one now has
#      BOTH: the band assertion stayed and route 0 added the glass beside it.)
#   3. DROP THE ASSERTION, in place, with the measured reason in the script
#      header. Never weaken it into something a flat fill can pass. hero-mode's
#      two Get-PaneColorCount probes went this way, and came back through route
#      0 - which is what T214 said would flip the trade.
#   4. INTERACTIVE BY DESIGN - keep it on the input desktop and declare it
#      below. Only for a script whose whole oracle is terminal content.
#
# THE FLAT-FILL LIMIT ITSELF HAS NOT MOVED. Route 0 is a way AROUND it, not a
# repeal of it: PrintWindow on a GhozttyTerminal child still returns one color,
# and Get-TestWindowPixels still refuses that capture. A probe that reaches for
# -AllowTerminalSurface because "T275 fixed capture" has misread this - route 0
# does not go through PrintWindow at all.
#
# ROUTE H - A HOVERED FRAME (`lib\HoverCapture.ps1`'s Get-TestHoverCapture,
# T282). Chrome, not terminal content, and a DIFFERENT limit from the one
# above: the pixels were always capturable, but the hovered FRAME was never
# painted. There is no real cursor here, so TrackMouseEvent makes the OS post
# WM_MOUSELEAVE within a frame of every posted WM_MOUSEMOVE, and WM_PAINT is
# the lowest-priority message in the queue - the leave is drained first and the
# frame that gets painted is the un-hovered one. An ORDERING problem, so no
# amount of retrying wins it (T209 measured 300 posted moves and never caught a
# lit fill). Get-TestHoverCapture has the APP hit-test, send the move, repaint
# and PrintWindow on ONE GUI-thread stack, which the message loop is never
# reached in the middle of. Use it for ANY hover fill; a Send-TestMouse move
# plus Get-TestWindowPixels cannot see one. The hover does not latch - the
# leave lands on the next pump exactly as before. That app-side PrintWindow is
# the SYNCHRONOUS one for the same reason -Sync is on this side (T845): the
# PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT copy it used at first is a DWM copy, and one in ten of
# them predated the hover paint.
#
# TERMINAL-CONTENT PROBES THAT STAY ON THE INPUT DESKTOP (declared, not
# missed - an undeclared exception is indistinguishable from an oversight):
#
#   profile-latency.ps1  (T53b) One assertion: the scroll-viewport pixel hash.
#                        The script is interactive anyway (SendInput timing IS
#                        the measurement) - see T272.
#
# `color-contrast.ps1` was the third entry here and is not one any more: route 0
# took it off the input desktop entirely (T275), which is what route 0 was for.
# Its old shape is the reason the audit's rule is written the way it is - it
# called neither SendInput nor SetForegroundWindow, and was input-desktop-only
# all the same because it read the composited screen (see T276).
#
# The guard that keeps this from regrowing is in Get-TestWindowPixels: it
# REFUSES a GhozttyTerminal capture unless -AllowTerminalSurface is passed,
# so a new probe cannot silently score itself against a flat fill.
# terminal-capture-guard.ps1 is the measured proof that the fill is real.
#
# MECHANISM LIMIT - VK_PACKET (measured here 2026-07-31, T217 batch 4):
# SendInput(KEYEVENTF_UNICODE) is how screen readers, on-screen keyboards and
# automation inject text; the app sees it as a WM_KEYDOWN with wParam
# VK_PACKET that TranslateMessage turns into a WM_CHAR. That cannot be
# reproduced by posting, and the obvious trick does NOT work: a posted
# WM_KEYDOWN(VK_PACKET, char in the lParam HIWORD) is never translated -
# measured on box, the character simply never arrives (the real packet
# carries its 16-bit character out of band, not in the 8-bit scan-code field
# of a posted lParam). A posted WM_CHAR to the same surface DOES arrive.
# So Send-TestInjectedChar posts WM_CHAR, which covers the app's injected-text
# handling (App.zig's WM_CHAR handler names direct posts as one of its two
# sources) but NOT App.run's TranslateMessage exemption for VK_PACKET. Do not
# label a WM_CHAR assertion as covering the packet path.
#
# Everything that touches the test desktop runs on ONE persistent worker
# thread: SetThreadDesktop is per-thread, and it fails outright on a thread
# that already owns windows or hooks - which the PowerShell host thread does.
# So window enumeration, focus, input and capture are all marshalled onto that
# thread; the functions below hide the marshalling.
#
# ESCAPE HATCH: `New-TestDesktop -Interactive` (or GHOZTTY_TEST_INTERACTIVE=1)
# skips the desktop entirely and drives the app on the interactive desktop the
# old way (GrabForeground + SendInput), because nobody can watch a window on a
# desktop they cannot see. It is for debugging by hand only - it steals focus,
# so it is never how an acceptance run is scored.
#
# INTERACTIVE BY DESIGN - the scripts that can only run on the INPUT DESKTOP
# (T272, widened by T276). Two ways to end up here, one list: taking the
# foreground / injecting input, and reading the COMPOSITED SCREEN (a screen DC,
# CopyFromScreen), which DWM produces for the input desktop only. The second is
# not a footnote - `color-contrast.ps1` was input-desktop-only for years while
# grabbing no input at all, and the sweep that was written to find "scripts that
# steal focus" could not see it.
#
# T217 closed at 23 of 23 and T218 at 13 of 13, and the fleet-wide claim
# became "the acceptance scripts no longer steal the user's foreground" - while
# two scripts sat in neither bucket, still grabbing, because nothing counted the
# remainder. Those two were migrated (T224, T225); what stops the property
# regrowing is that the remaining exceptions are DECLARED here rather than
# remembered. An undeclared grab site is indistinguishable from an oversight,
# which is how the first two went quiet. `lib\ForegroundAudit.ps1` PARSES the
# marker lines below and fails on any script that grabs and is not among them,
# so the prose a human reads and the set the check enforces cannot drift apart.
#
# @input-desktop-exception: context-menu-real-input.ps1 -- (T240) the subject IS a real right-click: a script that synthesizes the trigger cannot validate the trigger.
# @input-desktop-exception: profile-latency.ps1 -- (T53b) injection timing is the measurement, so a posted message would time the wrong path.
# @input-desktop-exception: test-desktop-spike.ps1 -- (T207) the spike that measured what does and does not work off the input desktop; it has to reach both.
# @input-desktop-exception: notification-click-real.ps1 -- (T572) the subject IS a real click on a shell-drawn toast: balloons render on the input desktop and nowhere else, and a posted WM_APP_TRAY cannot validate delivery.
# @input-desktop-exception: rdp-session.ps1 -- (T1253/T1316) its subject is the desktop being shipped over the wire, and arm G reads the COMPOSITE of a viewer surface with the dim overlay blended onto it; DWM composes only the input desktop.
#
# LAUNCHES ON THE USER'S DESKTOP - the second list, and a different question
# (T1193). The one above asks which scripts CALL an API that only works on the
# input desktop. This one asks which scripts START THE APP from a process
# sitting on the user's desktop, which no API name answers: `+new-window` is
# the one verb that auto-launches, and the window it spawns lands wherever the
# spawning process was. 50 scripts were doing that - including ipc-p1/p2/p3,
# the floor CLAUDE.md names for every change - while the fleet-wide claim was
# that the suite no longer steals focus. `lib\DesktopLaunchAudit.ps1` parses
# these markers; `desktop-launch-audit.ps1` is the sweep.
#
# Migrate with `Invoke-OnTestDesktop` (the CLI half) and `Start-OnTestDesktop`
# (the GUI half), then DELETE the entry - a migration that leaves its line
# behind fails the sweep as a stale declaration, which is what makes this list
# burn down instead of settling.
#
# @user-desktop-launch: context-menu-real-input.ps1 -- (T240) already interactive-by-design above: the subject IS a real right-click, so its app has to be on the input desktop too.
# @user-desktop-launch: notification-click-real.ps1 -- (T572) already interactive-by-design above: the toast the shell draws for our balloon only exists on the input desktop, so the app that raises it has to be there too.
# @user-desktop-launch: profile-latency.ps1 -- (T53b) already interactive-by-design above: injection timing is the measurement, and it can only be taken where input is injected.
# @user-desktop-launch: go-loop-guard.ps1 -- (T1193) the ONE bare launch is the fallback taken when New-TestDesktop throws - a desktop we cannot create must not cost the whole suite, and the fallback says so loudly before it runs.
# @user-desktop-launch: go-loop-resume.ps1 -- (T1478) the same fallback, for the same reason: its GUI arms stage a parked loop pane, and a desktop that cannot be created must degrade to the interactive one with a NOTE rather than skip the whole recovery proof.
#
# @user-desktop-launch: agent-job-escape.ps1 -- (T1238) its SUBJECT is the agent escaping a kill-on-close job, and the only escape tier that works from the pane-shell job chain is the shell-parent hop: measured on box, breakaway is ACCESS_DENIED and a background desktop has no shell window, so the app logs 'shell-parent spawn unavailable err=error.NoShellWindow' and spawns INSIDE the job. The measurement needs a desktop that has a shell.
# @user-desktop-launch: relaunch-guard.ps1 -- (T1238) same measured reason as agent-job-escape.ps1 above: its section F asserts the relaunched app lands OUTSIDE a kill-on-close job, and that escape needs the shell-parent hop, which needs a desktop with a shell window.

# T118: never inherit an IPC endpoint. A script started from one of the user's
# own panes inherits $GHOZTTY_IPC_SOCKET naming the USER'S app, and the CLI
# prefers a baked endpoint over the derivation - so leaving it set would aim
# the run at their terminal instead of the build under test. Same drop as
# CleanSlate.ps1, repeated here because not every GUI script sources both.
Remove-Item Env:GHOZTTY_IPC_SOCKET -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# T675: BuildMode.ps1 also carries the startup-escape suppression seam, and a
# GUI script that only sources this file must still get it - an app launched
# on the test desktop can still tier-1 breakaway out of a permissive job
# chain and hand its pid-tracked work to a twin. Repeated here for the same
# reason as the endpoint drop above.

Delete the DEBUG window-placement memory (T85) so the next launch opens at the
app's built-in 800x600 default instead of whatever the LAST debug window was
left at - including maximized.

WHY (T267). Every GUI script clears `session-layout-debug.json` before it
launches, and NONE of them cleared this second file, so a script that sets no
size inherited its window from whichever script ran before it. That makes a
script's SETUP a function of run order, and nothing fails when it goes wrong -
the geometry is simply different. It cost two real red runs against a build
that was behaving correctly: `chrome-merged-row.ps1` failed its own second run
(its section 7 maximizes, so the next run opened maximized, where the top edge
hit-tests HTCAPTION instead of HTTOP), and `tab-strip.ps1` went three red once
that was clean, because every condition it sets up is a RATIO of the tab run
and it had never controlled the window the ratio is taken of.

Cleared at LAUNCH rather than in each script's `finally`: a script that dies
mid-run cannot poison the next one, and a new script gets it for free.

The path is derived from `$env:LOCALAPPDATA` at call time, which is the same
value `CreateProcessW` is about to hand the child - so the throwaway-LOCALAPPDATA
scripts resolve to THEIR dir, not the user's. Only ever the `-debug` file: a
release build writes `window_placement`, which belongs to the user's installed
Ghoztty (the `Clear-DebugSessionLayout` rule in lib\CleanSlate.ps1).

Returns $true if a file was removed.

<#
Launch an executable ON the test desktop (STARTUPINFO.lpDesktop). Returns
{ Pid, Process }; Process is the usual System.Diagnostics.Process, so
$app.Process.HasExited works exactly as with Start-Process.

Launching ghoztty.exe also clears the debug window-placement memory
(Clear-TestWindowPlacement, T267) so window geometry never depends on run
order. -KeepWindowPlacement opts out, and is for the two scripts whose SUBJECT
is that memory (window-size-memory.ps1, reset-window-size.ps1): deleting the
file between their launches would delete the thing under test.

Launching ghoztty.exe ALSO runs the build-mode pre-flight (T1033): a non-debug
zig-out derives the endpoints the user's installed Ghoztty owns, and a test
desktop does not change that - the launched app dials the user's agent and
writes the user's state files, off-screen where nobody sees it happen. 80 GUI
scripts reach the app through this one helper and none of them asked, so the
gate rides the launch rather than 80 copies of one line. -AllowReleaseBuild is
the same explicit opt-in Reset-GhozttyTestState takes, for a script whose
SUBJECT is a release build. It runs before the desktop is resolved so the
refusal costs nothing and speaks first.

Run a CLI invocation ON the test desktop and WAIT for it, the way `& $Exe +verb`
runs one on the caller's. Returns { ExitCode, Output, Pid, TimedOut }.

WHY THIS EXISTS (T1193). `Start-OnTestDesktop` covers the GUI half of a script -
the app itself. It does not cover the other half, and for 50 scripts the other
half WAS the script: they never launched a window handle at all, they drove the
app with `& $Exe +new-window --target=...` and read `+list`. `+new-window` is
the one verb that auto-launches (`performIpc` in `src\apprt\win32\App.zig`
answers `error.NoRunningInstance` by spawning the app, and does it for no other
verb), and the app it spawns inherits the desktop of the CLI process that
spawned it. Run the CLI here and the window lands on the test desktop; run it
with `&` and it lands on whatever the user is reading. Measured on box
2026-09-01: a cold `+new-window` through this helper put both the startup window
and the named one on the test desktop, and no ghoztty process reported a
MainWindowHandle to the user's session.

Output is stdout AND stderr, interleaved into one file the way the child wrote
them - `StartProcess` points both handles at the same file - so a caller that
used `2>&1` keeps what it had. It comes back as a single string, `''` when the
child printed nothing.

`-TimeoutSec` bounds a CLI that never returns; the child is terminated and
`TimedOut` is $true, which a caller should assert on rather than reading an
exit code that means nothing. The default is generous because a COLD auto-launch
on a busy box is slow by design (`ipc_timeout.auto_launch_ms`).

-Client does NOT mean "client coordinates". It selects which RECTANGLE you
get - the client area rather than the frame - and returns it in the same
screen space as the other form, so `$cr.Left`/`$cr.Top` are the client
origin's position ON SCREEN and are exactly what an offset inside the client
is added to. A client rect that started at 0,0 would be useless here, since
everything downstream of this function is screen-space too.

That is deliberate, because it is what makes the two units line up: what
this returns is what Send-TestMouse, Get-TestMouseRoute and the pixel probes
all take. `$cr.Left + 40` is a screen point 40px inside the client, and it
can be passed to any of them unconverted.

The naming trap is real and has cost a red run: a local called `$cx`/`$cy`
built from `($r.Left + $r.Right) / 2` is a screen coordinate no matter what
it is called. Read the derivation, not the name.

WM_KILLFOCUS, so this is how "chrome X shows only while this window has the

T255. The hwnd of a MODAL dialog the app has put in front of $Window, or
IntPtr::Zero when there is none.

This is the answer to "why does this window ignore everything I post at it".
`ConfirmDialog.show` calls `EnableWindow(owner, FALSE)` for the length of its
own message loop, and a DISABLED window is one `DefWindowProc` discards every
`WM_SYSCOMMAND` for - so SC_MINIMIZE / SC_MAXIMIZE / SC_RESTORE / SC_CLOSE all
become no-ops while it is up, and a second WM_CLOSE only re-enters
`confirmCloseIfNeeded` and raises another one. Meanwhile `WM_NCHITTEST`,
`WM_PAINT` and our own `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN` handler all keep answering, because
the thread is pumping perfectly well. The window is not wedged; it is blocked.

On the INTERACTIVE desktop that state is obvious - there is a dialog on screen.
On a background test desktop nobody sees it, which is how it read for a while
as "this desktop cannot adjudicate window state" (the original T255 report).
Measured: a pane whose shell has a child process ("ping -n 60 127.0.0.1")
answers WM_CLOSE with enabled=False + a GhozttyConfirmDialog and ignores
SC_MINIMIZE; dismiss the dialog and the same SC_MINIMIZE iconifies the window.

Identified by BEHAVIOUR, not by class - so it finds the confirm dialog, the
rename dialog and anything else modal, with no list to keep in sync:

  1. the window must be DISABLED. That is what "blocked" means here, and it
     is the whole reason the posted commands vanish.
  2. among its owned, visible top-levels, the blocker is one that can take
     ACTIVATION. Every overlay this app owns - the scrollbar, the banner, the
     dim layer, the key-state indicator - is a visible owned popup too, and
     they are all WS_EX_NOACTIVATE precisely so they never steal focus. A
     window that cannot be activated cannot be the thing holding a modal
     loop, so that bit is the discriminator rather than a class allowlist.

found, so a test can drive window state instead of guessing why it cannot.

Returns a string: 'none' (nothing was blocking), or "<class>" of the dialog it
dismissed, or "<class>:stuck" if the dialog outlived the dismissal. Answering
with the class rather than a bool is deliberate - a script that had to clear a
dialog should be able to SAY which one in its output, because a confirm dialog
appearing where none was expected is itself a finding.

-Answer cancel (the default) posts WM_CLOSE, which every dialog here treats as
its cancel path, so the blocked window is left in the state the test set up.
-Answer ok presses the default button instead, for a test that WANTS the
confirmed action to proceed.

Post a mouse event at a SCREEN coordinate.

    Send-TestMouse -Window $top -Target $tabstrip -X $x -Y $y -Action down
    Send-TestMouse -Window $top -Target $top -X $x -Y $y -Action move

-X/-Y ARE SCREEN COORDINATES, and this function does the conversion (T327):
it SetCursorPos'es the point and then ScreenToClient's it per target to build
the lparam. Hand it client coordinates and they are converted a SECOND time,
landing the click one client origin up and to the left of where you aimed -
usually outside the control entirely. That is a silent miss, not an error:
the post succeeds, this returns $true, and the assertion after it fails
against a feature that works, which sends you looking in the app. It cost
T318 exactly that (a Kill button that opened nothing because the click never
reached it).

Get the point from Get-TestWindowRect, whose BOTH forms are screen-space -
`-Client` picks the client RECTANGLE, still positioned on screen - so an
offset inside a control is `$r.Left + 40`, never a bare `40`. Get-TestPixel
and the Find-/Test-ExactPixel probes are screen-space too, so a point read
off a capture can be clicked as-is.

-Target is the hwnd the message is POSTED to: posted messages skip hit
testing, so name the window that would really have received the click (the
child pane, not its parent). Defaults to -Window.

-Action is click (default) / down / up / move / doubleclick / wheel.
-Button is left (default) / right / middle. -Delta applies to wheel only.

-Action doubleclick follows the TARGET's class style, because the OS does:
a CS_DBLCLKS window (GhozttyWindow - the split divider's equalize gesture)
gets down/up/DBLCLK/up, and a window without that style (GhozttyTerminal, the
terminal surface, which counts its own clicks) gets down/up/down/up. Posting
the CS_DBLCLKS form at a surface loses the second click entirely, so the
word-select it was meant to trigger never happens (measured in T218). On the
non-client path the DBLCLK form is always sent, because CS_DBLCLKS governs
client double-clicks only.

CLIENT OR NON-CLIENT IS DECIDED THE WAY WINDOWS DECIDES IT (T263): the target
is asked WM_NCHITTEST at the point first, and an answer other than HTCLIENT
delivers the WM_NC* twin (WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN & co.) with the hit code in wparam
and the SCREEN point in lparam. That is what makes a caption-band click - the
"..." menu button, minimize, close, since T254 all client PIXELS the window
claims back through its hit test - actually reach a handler. Use -Client to
force the client message anyway, for a test whose subject IS that path.

Two consequences worth knowing:

  * HTNOWHERE / HTTRANSPARENT / HTERROR keep the client delivery, because all
    three mean "not me" and this harness posts to the hwnd you NAME.
  * A down on HTCAPTION hands DefWindowProc a window-drag, exactly as a real
    press on the title area does. Aim at a button, or expect a move loop.

This is the DECISION, not a guess at it: Send-TestMouse asks the same question
of the same window. Assert it when a script wants to say "this point is the
minimize button" before clicking, so a button that moved reads as a moved
button rather than as an action that did not happen.

A window that does not answer within 1.5s is reported HTCLIENT, which is the

Hammer unpaced left down/up pairs round-robin across several targets.

    Send-TestClickStorm -Targets $surfaces -Rounds 500

This is a LOAD SHAPE, not a gesture. Send-TestMouse settles ~100ms per click
so the app can act on it; a deadlock repro needs focus changes arriving faster
than the GUI thread drains them, which the same 1500 clicks through
Send-TestMouse would stretch to about four minutes.

THIS FUNCTION's -X/-Y are CLIENT coordinates, and it is the exception (T327):
one point is posted to every target as-is, and the targets are different
windows, so there is no single screen point that is inside all of them. The
default is a point inside any surface. Send-TestMouse next door takes SCREEN
coordinates and converts them itself - the two do not share a convention, so
do not carry a point from one to the other unconverted.

Returns the number of messages ACCEPTED, which is 2 * Rounds * Targets.Count
when every post landed. ASSERT IT (T107): a storm that posted nothing - dead
window, full queue - returns instantly and leaves every "under load"
assertion after it passing against no load.

But the count is a floor, not the oracle, and it was MEASURED not assumed
(T107 break-tests): an INVALID handle makes PostMessageW fail and the count
catches it, while a NULL handle SUCCEEDS - Windows posts to the calling
thread's own queue - so 3000 messages can be accepted by nobody. Always pair
the count with an oracle that the APP acted on the clicks: focus landing on
the storm's last target, which the storm ends every round on.

Capture a window's pixels via PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT) - the only
capture path that works on a background desktop, and only for GDI-painted
chrome (see CAPTURE LIMIT in this file's header; the OpenGL terminal surface
comes back as a flat fill).

Returns { Bitmap, Width, Height, Left, Top }. Bitmap is a System.Drawing.Bitmap
in WINDOW coordinates, so a screen coordinate maps to ($x - $shot.Left,
$y - $shot.Top). Dispose with Close-TestWindowPixels.
#>
<#
PrintWindow capture of a window, as a disposable Bitmap + its screen origin.

REFUSES the OpenGL terminal surface (T214). PrintWindow on a GhozttyTerminal
child returns a flat fill on a background desktop - one color, unchanged after
typing - so a probe aimed there reads a constant and scores green against a
pane that renders nothing. That is not a capture failure this function can
detect after the fact: a flat fill is a perfectly valid bitmap, and "is it
dark?" style assertions pass against it happily. So the refusal is by CLASS,
up front, before anyone can measure anything.

Pass -AllowTerminalSurface only to MEASURE the limit itself (that is what
terminal-capture-guard.ps1 does). For a real terminal-content probe, take one
of the four routes in the CAPTURE LIMIT header instead.

ALSO REFUSES A UNIFORM CAPTURE (T303). The class refusal above guards exactly
one window; the SAME flat fill comes back from every WinUI/XAML window, and
that family is most of the Win11 shell. PrintWindow on Task Manager's main
window returned a flat black 1379x1134 bitmap - one distinct color - and
reported SUCCESS, and a vertical-seam scan over it then found no seams, which
reads as "this app has no seam" rather than "there is no capture". So a capture
of a non-trivial window whose whole interior is one color is refused after the
fact, since there is no class list that could have predicted it. It RETRIES
first (-UniformTimeoutMs), because the other way a capture comes back uniform
is a window that has not painted yet - transient, where composition is
permanent - and the retry is what tells the two apart. -AllowUniform is the
opt-in, and it is separate from -AllowTerminalSurface on purpose: measuring the
terminal flat fill needs both, so neither switch quietly disarms the other.

-Sync captures through WM_PRINTCLIENT instead of DWM (T835). USE IT FOR EVERY
PIXEL ASSERTION on chrome that answers that message: the default DWM copy is
asynchronous and returns torn frames, so a measurement over it is a coin flip.
Three back-to-back default captures of one unchanged banner overlay put the end
of the same table row at 1062, 1283 and 1179 px while the app logged an
identical paint each time - a rendering bug that was never in the app. -Sync
throws on a window with no WM_PRINTCLIENT handler rather than returning the
blank frame such a window prints, so the answer there is to add the handler.

The fixture for an app-side "that handle is not mine" guard (T282's

handle is refused as "not a window" before any ownership check runs, and a
window on the INTERACTIVE desktop is refused the same way, since handles are
not reachable across desktops. Neither reaches the guard.

<#
Is this capture a flat fill - one color over its whole interior?

The two ways that happens are told apart by TIME, not by looking at the bitmap:
a WinUI/XAML window composites through DirectComposition and never paints into
the window DC, so it is uniform forever; a window caught mid-paint is uniform
for a few hundred milliseconds. Get-TestWindowPixels uses this in a retry loop
for exactly that reason.

A trivially small window is exempt: a 16x16 tool window really can be one
color, and a guard that fires on it is noise.

THE GRID IS DENSITY-BOUNDED, NOT COUNT-BOUNDED (T1282). `-Samples` alone makes
the step proportional to the window, so the bigger the window the coarser the
look - and the one thing this guard must never do is miss the painted part of a
capture that has one. A MAXIMIZED ghoztty window is the case that broke it: at
3858x2118 the fixed 24x24 grid steps 160x88 px, the only GDI-painted region is
the 40 px caption band across the top (the rest is the terminal's flat fill,
which is a documented limit and not a failure), and NOT ONE sample row landed
inside the band. `caption-bar.ps1` section 6 therefore died with "the capture is
UNIFORM" every run - a harness blind spot wearing a caption regression's
clothes, which is the class of red that costs a turn every time it is believed.

So `-MaxStep` caps the stride regardless of size: nothing thicker than it can
hide between sample lines. 16 px is the number because the smallest thing the
suite asserts on is the 32 DIP caption band, which is 32 px at 100% scale - two
sample rows inside it at the worst scale, three at this box's 1.25. The cost is
paid only when the capture really is flat: the scan returns on the FIRST
disagreeing sample, so a healthy capture still ends after a handful of pixels,
and the dense sweep only runs to completion on the path that was going to throw
anyway.

How much is in this capture? Test-TestCaptureUniform above answers the binary
question - is EVERY sampled pixel the same color - and a capture only has to
keep one stray pixel to slip past it. This answers the same question as a pair
of NUMBERS, so "the capture collapsed" is something a script can assert a floor
against instead of eyeballing a file size afterwards.

T1128: `hero-mode.ps1` saved a window shot on every run and asserted nothing
about it, and the saved file quietly went from 133921 to 41165 bytes - the
signature of an image that has lost most of its content - while the run scored
ALL PASS. A byte count is not available to the script that took the picture;
these two numbers are.

  Distinct  - how many distinct colors the grid sampled.
  TopShare  - the fraction of samples that are the single most common color.

A blank capture is `Distinct = 1, TopShare = 1.0`. Real window chrome over a
surface PrintWindow could not read scores around 23 / 0.60 (measured on this
box, 2026-09-02); a fully painted window of the same size scores 87 / 0.57. So
a floor of `Distinct >= 8` with `TopShare <= 0.90` separates "the capture died"
from "a known region of this window does not capture", which is a documented
limit and must not read as a regression.

Sampled on a grid rather than every pixel: GetPixel is a per-call marshal, and
2400 of them is milliseconds where 1.26M is a visible pause in every run.

<#
Number of distinct colors in a capture - the guard against scoring a probe
against nothing.

Two ways a capture is empty here, and BOTH sail through a naive threshold:
the OpenGL terminal surface always comes back as a flat fill (see CAPTURE
LIMIT above), and a window captured mid-paint comes back solid black, which
happily satisfies any "is it dark?" assertion. Measured in T216: the same
dark context menu read meanLum 0 / 1 color when captured 350ms after opening
and meanLum 52 / 53 colors at 400ms.

So a brightness probe should require real content before believing its own
number. Real GDI chrome (text, borders, separators) is always well into the
double digits.
