# BuildFresh.ps1 - T1028. Refuse, BEFORE anything is launched or typed, to
# GRADE a zig-out exe that is older than the sources it is being asked to
# measure.
#
# Dot-sourced by lib\BuildMode.ps1, and called from
# `Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild`, so every acceptance script that already gates
# on build MODE now gates on build FRESHNESS too, with no per-script edit.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Every `test\win32\*.ps1` that launches the app defaults `-Exe` to
# `<repo>\zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe`. Eleven of them run `zig build` first; the
# rest - including the P1-P3 floor - drive whatever copy happens to be on disk.
# Nothing checked that the copy came from the code under test.
#
# The false RED is merely annoying and self-correcting: on 2026-08-20 T316's
# first `relay-account.ps1` run reported 3 FAILURE(S) against an exe built four
# hours earlier, the code was right, and a rebuild made it green.
#
# The false GREEN is the defect. A change that a STALE exe still passes exits 0,
# and since T783 exiting 0 STAMPS the guard - so `scripts\guard-due.ps1`
# afterwards answers "this harness has been run against the code as it stands"
# about an exe that was never built from it. That is the single question the
# stamp exists to answer, and it can be made to lie without anybody acting in
# bad faith.
#
# WHY MTIME, AND NOT THE BAKED COMMIT
#
# `upgrade-staleness` compares a DELIVERED exe's baked commit against
# `git rev-parse HEAD`, which is exactly right for a delivery: what ships must
# be a commit. It is the wrong question here, in both directions:
#
#   * blind to uncommitted work - the state a turn is in for the whole of
#     steps 2-4, which is precisely when acceptance scripts run;
#   * red on a commit that changed nothing - the loop builds, tests, and THEN
#     commits, so at step 6 the exe's baked commit is the parent of HEAD while
#     its bytes are exactly what HEAD's sources produce. A hard refusal there
#     would fire on every turn, and a gate that cries wolf daily gets an
#     `-Allow` bolted onto every caller within a week.
#
# Newest relevant source mtime vs the exe's mtime answers the question actually
# being asked - "was this exe built from the tree as it now stands?" - and it
# answers it for uncommitted edits, for a `git pull` that brings in another
# seat's work (checkout stamps mtimes to now), and for a branch switch.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A SOURCE
#
# `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon`, and everything under `src\` EXCEPT `*.md` (a
# docs-only edit builds the same bytes) and `src\apprt\gtk\` (Linux's frontend,
# which this exe cannot contain). 1258 files, ~17ms, cached per process.
#
# THE ONE FALSE POSITIVE, AND ITS EXIT
#
# An edit to a `src\` file that is NOT in this exe's module graph - a Mac-only
# `src\apprt\embedded.zig` change arriving through a main intake, say - raises
# the high-water mark, and the remedial `zig build` then relinks nothing, so the
# exe's mtime does not move and the refusal would not clear. That would be a
# wedge, so the refusal names a second remedy that always terminates:
# `GHOZTTY_TEST_REBUILD_STALE=1` builds and, on success, writes a WITNESS beside
# the exe recording the high-water mark that build covered. A successful build
# IS the proof - relink or no relink - and the witness is what carries that
# proof to the next process. It is tied to the exe's mtime, so the moment the
# exe is rebuilt for real the witness stops applying.
#
# WHAT CATCHES WHAT (with BuildMode.ps1's table)
#
#   Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild - these bytes derive the USER'S endpoints.
#   Assert-GhozttyFreshBuild    - these bytes are not the code under test.
#
# Both speak before the first `+new-window`, and both are about the exe rather
# than about anything running, so both work on a cold box.
