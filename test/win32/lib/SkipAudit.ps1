# SkipAudit (T219) - a SKIP that a script's SUMMARY LINE does not mention is an
# un-run assertion wearing a green hat.
#
# The shape this exists for, measured (T217, 2026-07-31): `ipc-version.ps1`
# asserted the About box is a `#32770` MessageBox. It has been a native
# `GhozttyConfirmDialog` since the T50 chrome pass, so the assertion had been
# WRONG for months - and every run still printed `ALL PASS`, because the
# foreground grab kept losing the race on a busy box and the whole palette
# section took its `SKIP palette test: <reason>` branch instead. Migrating the
# script onto the test desktop made the chord land every time, and the stale
# assertion surfaced on the first run.
#
# A skip is legitimate - pwsh is not installed, there is no network, a release
# build compiled the debug oracle out. What is not legitimate is a skip the
# result cannot see. The loop reads ONE line (`| Select-Object -Last 1`, go.md),
# so a `(2 section(s) SKIPPED)` line printed ABOVE `ALL PASS` is invisible to
# the only reader there is.
#
# THE RULE, therefore, and it is about the last line rather than about skipping:
#
#     A script that can print a SKIP must name the count in the same line that
#     announces the verdict:
#
#         ALL PASS                  ->  ALL PASS (2 SKIPPED)
#         ALL PASS (37 assertions)  ->  ALL PASS (37 assertions, 2 SKIPPED)
#
# Two findings enforce it:
#
#   * `unreported` - the script emits SKIP somewhere and NO line that emits its
#     verdict references a skip count. This is the whole defect.
#   * `uncounted` - a skip site that records nothing, so the count the summary
#     prints is short. A counter that misses sites is worse than no counter: it
#     reads as an audited number.
#
# Exemptions, both narrow:
#   * a site that EXITS within two logical lines - it printed the last line
#     itself, so there is no later summary for it to be missing from
#     (`SKIP ALL: harness could not post keys`; `exit 0`).
#   * a `# skip-audit: <reason>` marker on, or in the three lines above, the
#     site - the same state-your-intent convention the `# persistence:` and
#     `# exitcode-audit:` markers use.
#
# What this does NOT see, stated so a clean sweep is not read as more than it
# is: whether a skip branch is taken OFTEN. That is the other half of T219 and
# no static reader can answer it - a branch that fires on every run and one that
# has never fired look identical in the text. What the rule buys is that when it
# does fire, the one line anybody reads says so.

# Deliberately sets no StrictMode: this file is dot-sourced INTO suite scripts,
# and a mode set here would silently change how every one of them evaluates.

# THE CANONICAL SHAPE. Two lines, no dependency on this file at runtime - a
# rule that needed 25 scripts to dot-source a library would be a rule with a
# migration attached. `$script:skipped++` on an undefined variable is 1 in
# PowerShell 5.1, so there is nothing to initialise:
#
#     Write-Host 'SKIP  pwsh: not installed on this box'; $script:skipped++
#     ...
#     "ALL PASS$(if ($script:skipped) { " ($script:skipped SKIPPED)" })"
#     "ALL PASS (12 assertions$(if ($script:skipped) { ", $script:skipped SKIPPED" }))"
#
# A script that already keeps a counter (`$script:skip`, `$script:skipped`)
# keeps it; only the summary line has to start naming it.

# Collapse backtick continuations so a wrapped call reads as one logical line,
# carrying the FIRST physical line number so a finding points somewhere a human
# can open. (Same helper shape as ExitCodeAudit; duplicated rather than shared
