# CleanSlateAudit.ps1 - the analyzer behind test\win32\cleanslate-audit.ps1 (T351).
#
# THE RULE IT ENFORCES
#
# An acceptance script must not carry its own kill of the app under test or its
# sibling agent. There is exactly one, in lib\CleanSlate.ps1 - `Stop-RepoGhoztty`
# (path-exact, refuses an exe outside the repo) and the full pre-fixture reset
# `Reset-GhozttyTestState` on top of it.
#
# WHY. T248 hoisted the reset and converted 19 scripts; by T351 there were 133
# private copies again, under six different names, with four different filters
# and eight different settle times. Two divergences were live in them:
#
#   * `$_.CommandLine -like '*zig-out*'` also matches a detached instance
#     running from `zig-out-release` (T53b) and kills it. Exact-exe does not.
#   * a copy that killed only `ghoztty.exe` left the agent owning the PTY, so a
#     pane from the previous run survived and `+new-window --target=` FOCUSED it
#     instead of running this run's fixture.
#
# N copies of one datum is N chances to be wrong and no way to notice (T257).
# This analyzer is the way to notice.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A FINDING
#
# A `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` query that names `ghoztty.exe` or
# `ghoztty-agent.exe` and whose pipeline reaches `Stop-Process` within the next
# few lines. Enumerations are NOT findings: plenty of scripts legitimately count
# or inspect processes, and only the KILL is the shared datum.
#
# THE EXEMPTION, AND WHY IT IS A COMMENT RATHER THAN A LIST
#
# Some kills are deliberately different - `agent-adopt.ps1` picks its fake agents
# out by a run marker, `agent-upgrade.ps1` matches `ghoztty-agent%` because the
# image name under test IS `ghoztty-agent.exe.bak`. Those are correct and must
# stay. A central allow-list of file names would go stale silently the moment one
# of them was rewritten; a marker ON the kill cannot, because it is deleted with
# the code it excuses:
#
#     # cleanslate-exempt: matches the t549 fake agents by run marker, not path
#
# within the six lines above the kill. The reason text is required - an empty
# marker is itself a finding, so "exempt" can never become a rubber stamp.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Private ghoztty kills in one script's text.

    .DESCRIPTION
    -Text takes the script as an array of lines. Returns one object per finding:
    Line (1-based), Kind ('private-kill' or 'empty-exemption'), Text (the query
    line, trimmed).

    The result UNROLLS, deliberately: every call site wraps it in `@(...)`, and a
    `return , @(...)` under that wrap would NEST instead - an empty result would
    then count as one phantom finding and a green sweep would go red for nothing
    (PS 5.1).

    a synthesized fixture, and auditing a rule against its own statement is a
    permanent finding that teaches nothing.
