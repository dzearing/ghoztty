# VerdictExitAudit (T221) - a script whose LAST LINE says FAILURE(S) and whose
# EXIT CODE says 0 is a red run wearing a green hat.
#
# The shape this exists for, measured: `chooser-menu.ps1` and
# `host-settings.ps1` both ended
#
#     if ($script:fail -eq 0) { "ALL PASS (...)" } else { "$($script:fail) FAILURE(S) (...)" }
#
# with no `exit` anywhere near it, so a run with five red assertions fell off
# the end of the script and left `$LASTEXITCODE` at 0. The summary line was
# correct and a human reading it saw the failure; anything SCORING the script -
# a suite driver, a `; if ($?)` chain, CI later - read it as a pass. (Both were
# fixed in passing by T218/T219 before this task reached them; the class was
# closed here.) `config-errors.ps1` had the identical bug and was fixed in T217.
#
# THE RULE:
#
#     The failure path of a script's verdict must terminate the script with a
#     nonzero exit code, and the pass path must not fall into the failure
#     verdict on its way out.
#
# Both halves matter, and the second is not hypothetical: the suite's other
# common verdict shape is an early return
#
#     if ($script:fail -eq 0) { "ALL PASS"; exit 0 }
#     "$script:fail FAILURE(S)"
#     exit 1
#
# where dropping the `exit 0` makes a GREEN run print FAILURE(S) and exit 1.
# One rule, two directions, which is what T221 asked for: exits 1 on failure
# AND exits 0 on success.
#
# Findings:
#
#   * `fallthrough`  - the failure path never reaches a nonzero exit. The whole
#                      defect.
#   * `exits-zero`   - the failure path reaches `exit 0` (or a bare `exit`).
#                      Worse than falling off the end, because it looks
#                      deliberate.
#   * `pass-falls-through` - the pass branch does not terminate, and the code
#                      after the verdict `if` prints a failure verdict. A green
#                      run announces failure.
#   * `no-verdict`   - the file emits no `ALL PASS` at all, so there is no
#                      verdict to score. Legitimate for a helper (see the
#                      marker below); a defect for an acceptance script.
#
# Exemption, narrow and stated: a `# verdict-audit: <reason>` marker anywhere in
# the file, the same state-your-intent convention the `# persistence:`,
# `# exitcode-audit:` and `# skip-audit:` markers use. `ipc-fake-server.ps1`
# carries one - it is a helper process with no verdict to report, and "fixing"
# it would be inventing a verdict for something that does not assert anything.
#
# What this does NOT see, so a clean sweep is not read as more than it is:
# whether the code the failure path exits with is nonzero when it is COMPUTED
# rather than written (`exit ([int]($failures -gt 0))`, `exit $(if (...) {0} else {1})`).
# No static reader can evaluate that, and two scripts legitimately do it. Such
# an exit satisfies the rule here; the on-the-wire section of
# `verdict-exit-audit.ps1` is what measures the real code, both directions.
#
# This reads the AST rather than the text, unlike its two sibling audits, and
# the reason is specific: `exit 1` lives on the SAME line as the verdict in most
# of this suite (`else { "$fail FAILURE(S)"; exit 1 }`), and a line-oriented
# reader must then decide what "near" means. A naive one written first reported
# 128 of 160 scripts. Branch membership is a structural question, so ask the
# parser.

# Deliberately sets no StrictMode: this file is dot-sourced INTO suite scripts,
# and a mode set here would silently change how every one of them evaluates.
