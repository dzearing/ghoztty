# TestClient.ps1 - T359. Produce `remote-test-client.exe` on demand, so a tree
# that has only ever run the normal build can still run the acceptance scripts
# that drive a real agent.
#
# Dot-source it and resolve once, EARLY - before a script redirects
# %LOCALAPPDATA% or takes an isolated endpoint, because this shells out to zig:
#
#     . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'lib\TestClient.ps1')
#     $ClientExe = Resolve-RemoteTestClient -ClientExe $ClientExe
#     if (-not $ClientExe) { ... }   # the reason was already printed
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `remote-test-client` is an ON-DEMAND build target (`build.zig`: its own
# `zig build remote-test-client` step, reachable from nothing the default
# install step builds). Six acceptance scripts need it - it is the only thing
# on the box that speaks the agent protocol without a GUI - and every one of
# them used to open by asserting the file exists. So a clean tree failed them
# with `FAIL remote-test-client exists`, which reads like the agent failed to
# build rather than "this binary was never asked for". Two of those scripts
# (agent-pipe, agent-user-env) then exit 1 on the spot, and their remaining
# ~30 assertions never run.
#
# Building it here rather than adding it to the default install step is
# deliberate: the default build stays lean, and the prerequisite is declared at
# the point of use by the script that actually needs it - the same shape as the
# delivery launcher building its own staging release instead of assuming one.
#
# Debug, always. The scripts around this one drive `zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe`,
# which lib\BuildMode.ps1 requires to be a Debug build (endpoint isolation,
# T350); a client built any other way would be the odd one out in the same
# zig-out.

# Dot-sourced into the caller's scope, so it inherits the house setting the
# other libs here take: strict mode off (these scripts test on missing/empty
# values constantly and a StrictMode throw would read as a product failure).
Set-StrictMode -Off
