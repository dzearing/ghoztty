#
#     . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'BuildMode.ps1')
#     Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild -Exe $Exe
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `-Exe zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe` chooses which CLI BINARY runs. It does not
# choose which APP that CLI reaches, nor which AGENT: both are named endpoints
# derived from the BUILD MODE, and a mode that is not "debug" derives exactly
# the endpoints the user's installed Ghoztty already owns.
#
#   is_debug (Debug, ReleaseSafe)  ->  \\.\pipe\ghoztty-debug-<user>
#                                      \\.\pipe\ghoztty-agent-debug-<user>
#                                      %LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\...-debug\...
#   otherwise (ReleaseFast, ReleaseSmall)
#                                  ->  \\.\pipe\ghoztty-<user>
#                                      \\.\pipe\ghoztty-agent-<user>
#                                      the user's own state files
#
# So a `zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32` run WITHOUT `-Doptimize=Debug` leaves a
# release build in zig-out, and from that moment the whole suite drives the
# user's terminal: `+new-window` opens windows in it, the path-filtered kills
# match nothing (different ExecutablePath), and every assertion measures a
# binary nobody here built. Nothing reports an error; the scripts pass.
# Observed for real on 2026-08-02 (T248): `zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe +list --json`
# answered `"exe":"...\Programs\Ghoztty\ghoztty.exe"`, and the user's running
# terminal was holding leaked `ipc-p1.ps1` fixture windows.
#
# WHY BUILD MODE, AND NOT "IS A PRIVATE PIPE SUFFIX SET"
#
# `GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX` (T441 / Isolation.ps1) moves the APP endpoint and
# nothing else. Isolating a release-lineage run takes THREE knobs, because the
# agent half and the file half are named separately:
#
#   GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX     the app's IPC pipe
#   GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE  the agent's guard mutex, heartbeat, pipe, state dir
#                           and autostart Run value (T167; honored in RELEASE
#                           builds too, unlike the staleness/proto test hooks)
#   LOCALAPPDATA            every file either of them writes
#
# One or two of the three is the dangerous state, not a partial win: a release
# build under a private pipe suffix alone still dials the agent that owns the
# user's live sessions, which is what this gate exists to stop. Build mode is the
# one thing a cold-box check can read off the exe itself, so it stays the gate;
# a script that really does set all three says so with -Allow and proves it with
# its own assertions (test\win32\agent-instance-lineage.ps1 -Release is the
# pattern - it measures the user's agent and Run values before and after).
#
# WHAT CATCHES WHAT
#
#   Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild  (this file)  - the exe we are ABOUT to launch;
#                                               works on a cold box, where
#                                               nothing answers yet.
#   Assert-GhozttyFreshBuild     (BuildFresh) - that same exe is older than the
#                                               sources it would measure, so a
#                                               green run would stamp a guard
#                                               about code it never saw (T1028).
#                                               Called from the assert below, so
#                                               every caller gets it for free.
#   Assert-GhozttyUnderTest      (CleanSlate) - the app ALREADY answering is a
#                                               different install.
#   Assert-GhozttyPrivateEndpoint / -Isolated (Isolation) - the suffix took, and
#                                               we are not in the caller's app.
#
# The first is the only one that can speak before the first `+new-window`, which
# is the moment a leaked fixture becomes visible in the user's terminal.

# asked together by everything that already asks the first.

    `ipc_client.endpointPath` and `LocalAgent.pipeName` switch on. Debug and

    `builtin.mode` without needing a running server, which is what makes this
    usable on a cold box. (`+list --json`'s `build.mode` reports the RUNNING
    app instead, and on a cold box there is none.)

    Returns the mode as printed, minus zig's leading dot; $null when the exe is
    missing or prints no such line. The `Running Instance` section also carries
    a `- mode` line, so the match is anchored on `build mode`.

function Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Throw unless $Exe's endpoints are the debug ones - i.e. not the user's.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Call this before the app under test is launched. Returns the build mode on
    success.

    -Allow (or GHOZTTY_TEST_ALLOW_RELEASE=1) is the opt-in for a script whose
    SUBJECT is a release build - an upgrade or delivery test, or a release-
    lineage acceptance run under the three isolating knobs above. It is
    deliberately an explicit act: there is no env var that makes a release run
    safe, only one that says "I know, and this script is about that build".

    T1158: the opt-in is CHECKED, not trusted. A release-lineage run must hold
    all three isolating knobs (Get-GhozttyReleaseSandboxGaps names the ones it
    is missing) - or say, with -UserEndpoints -Reason '<why>', that reaching the
    user's real endpoints IS the point and it opens no panes. `-Allow` on its
    own used to return unconditionally, and that unchecked return is what let
    `soak.ps1` seed the user's agent with pinned sessions nothing could reap.

    A mode this file cannot read at all (an exe that does not run, or one too
    old to print the line) is refused for the same reason an unknown mode is:
    a run we cannot vouch for is exactly the run that leaks into the user's
    terminal.

Isolating a release-lineage run takes all THREE knobs. The one-liner is:

    Set-GhozttyTestIsolation -Tag '<script>' -ReleaseSandbox

shells in the user's agent as pinned sessions nothing can reap, and the 5am
refresh restarted the user's terminal into the accumulated pile.

local agent's pipe and its state files are the ones the user's INSTALLED Ghoztty
owns, and this script would open windows in the user's terminal, type into it,
and then report a pass about a binary nobody here built.

A private GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX does not fix this on its own: it moves the app's
pipe and nothing else. The agent half needs GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE (T167,
honored in release builds too) and the file half needs LOCALAPPDATA - all three
or none, see Get-GhozttyReleaseSandboxGaps.

Rebuild zig-out the way CLAUDE.md says, and re-run:
    zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32 -Doptimize=Debug

If this script's SUBJECT really is a release build (an upgrade or delivery
test), say so explicitly: pass -Allow to this assert, or set
GHOZTTY_TEST_ALLOW_RELEASE=1 for the run. Since T1158 that opt-in is CHECKED,
not taken on trust - a release-lineage run that opens panes must hold all three
isolating knobs, or declare -UserEndpoints -Reason '<why>'.
