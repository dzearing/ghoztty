# Machine-chooser SESSION ROSTER acceptance (tracker T318).
#
# The Ctrl+Shift+N chooser's detail pane now lists the selected machine's live
# agent sessions - a liveness dot, the label ladder, activity/status badges,
# cwd + command sublines and a Kill button (Mac's `detailSessions`,
# MachineChooserView.swift:544/:608-730). This script drives that end to end
# against a REAL local agent with REAL sessions:
#
#   1. the roster loads OFF the GUI thread and lands: the app logs
#      "chooser roster: loaded N session(s)", and N equals what
#      `ghoztty +sessions --json` reports from the same agent;
#   2. cards are actually PAINTED - the first card's fill is measurably
#      lighter than the dialog background it sits on;
#   3. Kill ends the session: clicking the first card's Kill button opens the
#      destructive confirmation, approving it logs the close, the agent
#      confirms it, and `+sessions` stops listing that id.
#
# WHY A LOG LINE IS THE ORACLE. The roster is owner-drawn on the dialog's own
# surface - there are no HWNDs to read back with WM_GETTEXT, so "what did it
# load" cannot be measured the way a control's caption can. The count is said
# out loud by the app (SessionRoster.adopt) and cross-checked against an
# INDEPENDENT source (`+sessions`, which dials the agent directly and does not
# go through the app at all). The pixels answer the separate question of
# whether anything was drawn.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL (run 2, mandatory - a pixel probe with no negative control
# is a probe of the background): with the agent killed the roster resolves to
# `failed`, and the same probe point must come back AT the dialog background.
# Without this, "the card is lighter than the background" would pass against a
# chooser that painted no roster at all as long as some other chrome happened
# to sit there.
#
# T248: the repo's agent AND its app are killed at setup, so the fixture is
# built fresh every run instead of measuring the previous run's sessions.
# T267: the script sets its own window size rather than inheriting whatever
# the last GUI script left in window_placement-debug.
