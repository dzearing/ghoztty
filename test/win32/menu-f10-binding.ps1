# T575 acceptance: a user binding on F10 fires, and does not open the menu.
#
# F10 opens the menu bar on Windows, and `Surface.trackMenuActivation` claims
# the key before `keyCallback` ever sees it (T190). Claiming it UNCONDITIONALLY
# meant a `keybind = f10=...` was accepted by the config and then silently never
# dispatched - and the menu it opened instead swallowed every following key, so
# the keyboard read as stuck. This script is the oracle for the narrowing: the
# binding wins where the user stated an intent, the platform default survives
# everywhere else.
#
# Four launches, because a keybind set is app-wide and each phase needs a
# different one:
#
#   A: `--keybind=f10=new_tab` - F10 opens a TAB and NO menu.
#   B: no f10 binding at all - F10 opens the MENU and no tab. This is the
#      positive control for A's "no menu appeared": without it, a build that
#      broke menu activation outright would pass A, C and D vacuously.
#   C: `--keybind=f9>f10=new_tab` - F10 as the SECOND HALF of a sequence still
#      reaches the binding, which is the case the sketch in T575 named as the
#      one that must not open a menu.
#   D: `--keybind=f7=activate_key_table:t575` + `--keybind=t575/f10=new_tab` -
#      the same for an active key table.
#
# ORACLES, both by outcome and both structural:
#
#   - THE ACTION: the tab count from `+list --json`, polled (opening a tab is
#     asynchronous - the key posts a message, the app then spawns a shell). Not
#     the debug log, so the script measures the same thing against a release
#     build.
#   - THE MENU: the live popup window (class #32768) owned by this app's pid,
#     via Wait-TestPopupMenu. "No menu" is asserted with a real wait, not a
#     single glance.
#
# F10 is delivered as WM_SYSKEYDOWN/WM_SYSKEYUP (Send-TestSysKey), which is how
# Windows delivers it for real; f9 and f7 are ordinary posted key messages.
# Unmodified function keys throughout: a posted WM_KEYDOWN carries no modifier
# state off the input desktop, so a chord-based binding would be untestable
# here while a function key exercises the identical core path.
#
# Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1), so it never takes
# the user's foreground - asserted, not assumed.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts A's expectation (it demands that F10 open the menu
# even with a binding) and MUST fail; it is how a run proves the menu probe
# reads the live popup rather than returning a constant.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
