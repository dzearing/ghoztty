# T199 acceptance: a harness never leaves a live ghoztty behind in its own
# scratch directory.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\harness-process-leak.ps1
#
# THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. On 2026-07-29 a debugging run pointed the delivery
# script at a stand-in install dir (`%TEMP%\gh-dbg2\install`). Delivering is
# exactly the job that ENDS by launching the app, so the run left a live GUI
# ghoztty behind - windows, message loop, possibly an IPC pipe instance. It was
# found by eye NINETEEN HOURS later while taking the pre-state for an unrelated
# delivery. A stray file is litter; a stray app is an oracle problem, because
# every later process or pipe assertion on this box has to answer "is that
# ghoztty mine or the leak's?".
#
# The reason no existing helper covered it: lib\CleanSlate.ps1's
# Stop-RepoGhoztty REFUSES any exe outside the repo, by design, so a stand-in
# install dir is precisely what it cannot clean up. lib\HarnessLeak.ps1 is the
# missing counterpart, and this script is its teeth.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#
#   A (safety)   the root check refuses what it must - an empty root, a
#                relative root, %TEMP% itself, a drive root, the user's install
#                dir - and accepts a proper scratch root under TEMP or the repo.
#   B (live)     a REAL ghoztty GUI launched from a scratch install dir is
#                found by path, is invisible to the repo-scoped teardown (the
#                gap), and is killed by Stop-HarnessGhoztty.
#   C (failure)  a harness that dies MID-RUN still tears down: a child that
#                registers its root, launches, then throws leaves nothing.
#   D (teeth)    the same child WITHOUT the registration leaks - so C is a
#                measurement, not a tautology.
#   F (build)    the same teardown for the ORDINARY case (T1127): a script
#                names the build it drives with -Exe, everything under that
#                directory is reaped on exit - failure path included - and an
#                exe outside the repo arms nothing. F4 is its teeth.
#   R (autostart) the REGISTRY twin of the same leak (T1168): an isolated run
#                never leaves a `HKCU\...\Run\GhozttyAgent-<instance>` startup
#                program behind - not on a normal exit, not on a throw, and not
#                after a kill (the next clean slate sweeps it). R7/R9 are its
#                teeth, R10/R11 prove the SUITE entry point arms it rather than
#                only the library, R13 proves the user's own entry is untouched,
#                and R14 is the standing arm that must stay at zero.
#   E (sweep)    right now, on this box, no ghoztty process is running out of
#                %TEMP% at all. This is the standing arm that must stay at zero;
#                a failure names the pid, the path and the age in hours.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run scratch root, a private IPC pipe suffix and a private
# LOCALAPPDATA for section B, the GUI on the BACKGROUND test desktop, and every
# kill filtered on ExecutablePath under this run's own root.
