# T229 acceptance: the shared ghoztty.log must not LOSE lines under concurrent
# writers.
#
# %LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\ghoztty.log is a single sink that the GUI app, the
# agent and every one-shot `ghoztty +...` CLI invocation append to at the same
# time - on a box driving Ghoztty from scripts there are several a second. The
# old writer opened the file, seeked to end, wrote and closed. That is not an
# append: two processes that both resolve end-of-file to N both write AT N, and
# the later write silently overwrites the earlier one's bytes.
#
# Why this is a T229 assertion and not a tidy-up: the whole primary evidence for
# T229 was "the app logged nothing after the confirm", and the fix for it is a
# trail of log lines through the destructive restart. Both are worthless if the
# sink drops lines whenever something else is running. The fix is
# FILE_APPEND_DATA (main_ghostty.zig openAppendW), which Windows defines as
# placing each write at the current end of file as one operation.
#
# The oracle is line COUNT and line SHAPE, measured on the real binary:
#   - every launched process contributes its startup banner, so the total is
#     deterministic per build;
#   - a clobbered line is detectable without knowing the count: the writer only
#     ever emits lines starting with the T270 prefix and a log level, so a line
#     that does not is a line something wrote over.
#
# T270 adds the second half of the sink's contract to this script: surviving
# lines have to be READABLE, not just present. Every line carries
# `<iso-8601-utc-millis> <pid> ` ahead of the level, which is what makes the
# shared file demultiplexable by process and orderable in time - the two things
# T229's own investigation could not do. The assertions below are the ones that
# matter for that: the shape holds on EVERY line, each writer's own pid is in
# there, a pid's lines are monotonic in time, and the prefix is part of the same
# single write as its message (a prefix written separately could land after
# another process's line and split this one in half - the T229 defect, back
# again by another route).
#
# Release build only - the file sink is compiled out of Debug builds (they log
# to stderr). Hermetic: its own LOCALAPPDATA and IPC pipe suffix, and it only
# runs `+list`, which touches nothing.
