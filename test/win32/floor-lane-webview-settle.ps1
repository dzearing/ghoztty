.SYNOPSIS
  Acceptance test for scripts\lib\WebViewLane.ps1 and floor-lane.ps1's
  between-lane WebView2 settle (T592).

.DESCRIPTION
  Two of the four floor lanes stand up a REAL WebView2 environment, and
  `-Lane all` used to start the next lane the instant the previous one exited.
  Three times in two days that produced a red floor that was not red code: the
  incoming lane asked for an environment while the outgoing lane's browser tree
  was still tearing down and got hr=0x80004005 for it. Each occurrence cost a
  turn, and a gate that goes red for a scheduling artifact teaches the loop to
  re-run its own floor instead of reading it.

  The behavior under test is three things: WHICH msedgewebview2.exe processes
  belong to a test lane (the browser AND the renderer/GPU children, which carry
  the private profile but not the embedder's exe name), that the wrapper WAITS
  for them rather than returning on Stop-Process, and that a wait which runs out
  is SAID rather than swallowed -- so the next red lane can be read against it.

  Everything runs against a FIXTURE: a private copy of cmd.exe named
  msedgewebview2.exe (the CIM filter matches on the image name, so the fixture
  has to carry it) blocking on a `waitfor` signal that never arrives, with the
  marker under test trailing after a `rem`. That is how the fixture's command
  line carries `ghoztty-wv2test-` or `--webview-exe-name=` without running a
  browser -- a marker cannot go in waitfor's own signal name, which rejects `-`
  and `=`. Nothing here can touch a real WebView2: the user's own viewer panes
  run under `--webview-exe-name=ghoztty.exe` and their own profile, and arm 3 is
  the proof that a process carrying neither test marker is left alone.

  Arms 1-3 are identity, 4-6 the wait (fast, slow, and the give-up), 7 the
  wording, 8 the sweep, 9 the profile-directory prune, 10-11 the wiring in
  floor-lane.ps1, 12 end-to-end through a real lane run.

  Arms 13-18 are the acceptance-run half (T678): a lane can also start into a
  repo-built debug Ghoztty's viewer panes, which carry NEITHER test marker --
  `viewer-panes.ps1` alone stands up seventeen of them. They cover the
  debug-profile identity, the release profile being untouchable (that is the
  user's own terminal), those panes never being claimed by the KILLING sweep,
  and the wait being asked for by the lane that starts behind them.

  Prints a single ALL PASS / N FAILURE(S) line, like every other script here.

  ASCII-only by design (PS 5.1 on this box mangles non-ASCII on rewrite).
