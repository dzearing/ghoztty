# T207 deliverable 1 - the spike that decides the shape of the whole task.
#
# Question: can the GUI acceptance scripts run on a SEPARATE Win32 desktop
# (CreateDesktopW), so they stop stealing the user's foreground?
#
# Three sub-questions, all answered here against a real ghoztty launch:
#   1. ISOLATION - does a window created on a background desktop stay off the
#      interactive desktop (never enumerable there, never foreground there)?
#   2. INPUT     - does SendInput from a thread bound to that desktop reach the
#      app? (asserted end-to-end: ctrl+shift+t must add a tab, read back over
#      IPC from the normal desktop.)
#   3. CAPTURE   - is anything COMPOSED there? DWM composes only the input
#      desktop, so the 6 pixel-probe scripts are the known risk. Three capture
#      paths are measured: BitBlt from the desktop DC (what
#      Graphics.CopyFromScreen does), PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT), and
#      PrintWindow with no flags. Each is scored BY REGION - see below.
#
# The app is launched with --window-theme=light on purpose: a light window is
# bright, so "capture returned black" is unambiguous rather than a plausible
# dark-terminal reading.
#
# ANSWERS (isolation/input measured on box 2026-07-30; capture re-measured
# 2026-09-02 by T1115, which overturned the original reading - see below. The
# assertions encode them, so this script doubles as the regression test for the
# T211 harness):
#   isolation - total. Not enumerable on the interactive desktop, never
#               foreground there.
#   input     - SendInput is BLOCKED (0 events accepted, ACCESS_DENIED); a
#               background desktop is not the input desktop. Posted
#               WM_KEYDOWN works, and modifier chords work when the key state
#               is set on the input queue we share via AttachThreadInput.
#   capture   - SPLIT, and the split is the whole answer. The window CHROME is
#               captured faithfully by PrintWindow; the TERMINAL SURFACE is not
#               captured at all. CopyFromScreen/BitBlt is dead outright.
#
# ---- T1115: how the capture answer changed, and why the old one was wrong ----
#
# The correction itself is not new. `lib\TestDesktop.ps1` measured and wrote it
# down on 2026-07-30 ("REVISES T207's answer ... the spike's 'PrintWindow
# returns real content' was reading the tab strip it had enabled, not the
# terminal"), and the harness has been built on that ever since. What went
# unreconciled for a month is THIS FILE, which kept asserting the answer the
# library had already overturned. T1115 is that reconciliation, plus the
# measurement below of what the oracle was actually doing wrong.
#
# Until 2026-09-02 this script asserted "PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)
# returns real content" by scoring mean luminance over the WHOLE window and
# requiring it to be bright. That oracle cannot distinguish the two outcomes it
# exists to tell apart: the terminal surface is dark by design and fills most of
# the window, so a capture consisting of light chrome over a flat dark client
# area scores about the same as a capture of the whole thing. It read as a pass
# in July and as a fail later only because the chrome shrank relative to the
# surface - the underlying behavior never changed.
#
# Scored BY REGION on this box (2026-09-02, Debug zig-out, 984x639 window,
# GhozttyTerminal child at 9,160 782x431):
#
#   route                              chrome band        below chrome
#   ---------------------------------  -----------------  -----------------
#   BitBlt off the desktop DC          BitBlt returns FALSE - nothing at all
#   PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)  mean 79 dist 103   mean 41 dist 2
#   PrintWindow(flags=0)               mean ~80 dist ~100 mean ~40 dist ~2
#
# distinct==2 over the entire client area is a flat fill: the surface was never
# composed. The chrome reading is the positive control - the same bitmap, the
# same sampler, 103 distinct colors - so "the surface is flat" is a measurement
# and not a broken capture.
#
# The INTERACTIVE-desktop control (same build, same call - PrintWindow on the
# TOP-LEVEL window, then the child's rect sampled out of that bitmap - one-off
# probe run 2026-09-02 alongside this script, 800x600 window, GhozttyTerminal
# child at 9,40 782x551):
#
#   route                              chrome band        SURFACE rect
#   ---------------------------------  -----------------  -----------------
#   PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)  mean 203 dist 35   mean 45 dist 102
#   PrintWindow(flags=0)               mean 207 dist 55   mean 45 dist 102
#   BitBlt off the desktop DC          (whole window: mean 55 dist 406)
#
# So the SAME call over the SAME region returns 102 distinct colors on the
# interactive desktop and 1-2 on the background one. The flat surface is
# therefore DESKTOP-dependent, not an unconditional property of PrintWindow.
#
# HOW THAT SITS WITH `lib\TestDesktop.ps1`, WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH HERE.
# That file's CAPTURE LIMIT and its general rule (T303: "PrintWindow sees GDI,
# not composition") already state the operative conclusion, and this spike does
# not overturn them - it had simply never been reconciled with them. Note the
# difference in what was measured, so the two are not read as contradicting:
# TestDesktop.ps1 measured PrintWindow on the GhozttyTerminal CHILD hwnd (1
# distinct color, and a black-vs-white --background reading the same), which is
# a different call from the top-level capture measured here. Both agree on the
# thing that matters: on a BACKGROUND desktop the terminal surface cannot be
# asserted, and Get-TestWindowPixels is right to throw on a uniform interior.
#
# THE DECISION THIS SPIKE PRODUCES, for T1100 and the pixel-probe scripts:
#
#   * A probe that asserts TERMINAL CONTENT pixels (glyph colors, cursor,
#     selection highlight, anything the renderer draws into the terminal
#     surface) CANNOT run on a background desktop. All three capture routes
#     were measured here; there is no fourth to go looking for.
#   * A probe that asserts CHROME pixels (title bar, tab strip, banner, the
#     window's own painted controls) CAN run there, via PrintWindow into a
#     memory DC. It just cannot use CopyFromScreen.
#   * Screenshotting the desktop as a whole is unavailable either way.
#   * For a terminal-content probe that must survive, do NOT invent a route
#     here: `lib\TestDesktop.ps1` carries the decided ladder (route 0 asks the
#     app for its own pixels over the debug `capture-pane` IPC action, then
#     three fallbacks, then interactive-by-design). Follow it there.
#
# This script is SAFE to run while the user is working - that is the entire
# point of it. It asserts that itself (P3/P4).
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out, and it
# talks to its own IPC endpoint via GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX so the user's real
# instance is never queried or disturbed.
