# Somebody actually installs the installer, and clicks through it (T1299).
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Every claim this repo makes about the Windows installer
# is made at its SOURCE (`test\win32\install-launch.ps1`, `install-prepare.ps1`,
# `install-maintenance.ps1` section A read `dist\windows-installer\build-msi.sh`)
# or at BUILD time (the read-back verifiers inside build-msi.sh, compiled on
# every push by fork-ci). Nothing on this box had ever run `msiexec /i` against
# a real package and looked at what came out. So the way an installer defect was
# found was that the user installed it and it broke - three times in a fortnight
# (T1204 the reboot demand, T1205, T1291 the silent same-version exit).
#
# WHY THAT WAS HARD, and how each half is bought here:
#
#   * Building a package needs wixl (GNOME msitools), which on this box lives
#     only inside Docker, and starting Docker is the user's call. So the package
#     is not built here: it is DOWNLOADED. The default subject is the newest
#     PUBLISHED `win-v*` release - the bytes a user actually installs - and
#     `-Msi` takes any local package instead (one pulled from a CI run, or one
#     built on a box that has wixl).
#   * Installing the real product would replace the user's Ghoztty, which is
#     this repo's first non-negotiable. `scripts\msi-test-identity.ps1` is the
#     answer already in the tree: it rewrites the published package into a
#     product with its own ProductCode, UpgradeCode, install directory,
#     component GUIDs, registry key and Start Menu name. What installs here
#     lands in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GhozttyT1299Test and cannot upgrade,
#     remove or refcount anything of the user's. `-TeethCheck` is the
#     demonstration that the refusal enforcing that actually fires.
#
# THE FOUR-ACT WALK, which is the whole point - each act asserts the OUTCOME a
# person would see, never msiexec's exit code alone:
#
#   A  the package: obtained, rewritten, and provably not the shipping product.
#   B  FRESH INSTALL. Files on disk (all three exes and the fallback OpenGL),
#      the PATH entry, the Start Menu shortcut, an Apps & Features entry at the
#      right version, the installed exe answering +version, and a real terminal
#      window opening on a test desktop (T1176).
#   C  UPGRADE over an older version. The exe SURVIVES (T23's 26.7.502
#      postmortem: the "upgraded" install had no ghoztty.exe), the registered
#      version moves, no reboot is demanded (T1204), and the PATH entry is not
#      duplicated.
#   D  SAME VERSION AGAIN - the case this task was filed from (T1291). The
#      package enters maintenance mode, the app's Repair / Cancel dialog appears
#      on screen, and Cancel ends the transaction at 1602 with the install
#      untouched. Skipped, named, when the package predates the feature: a
#      release published before T1291 has no MaintenancePrompt row to run.
#   E  OLDER PACKAGE OVER A NEWER INSTALL. A plain explanation, not a bare 1638,
#      and nothing about the install moves.
#   F  UNINSTALL. Nothing left behind: no directory, no Apps & Features entry,
#      no PATH entry, no shortcut.
#   G  and the user's Ghoztty is measured before and after, every run.
#
# The version pair acts B/C/E need is minted from ONE package:
# `msi-test-identity.ps1 -ProductVersion` registers the same payload at a lower
# ProductVersion, which is the only honest predecessor available without a
# second published release.
#
# preflight: none - the binaries here come out of a PUBLISHED package, so they
# are release builds by definition and `Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild` would
# refuse them. The isolation is bought a different way: `-ReleaseSandbox` gives
# the run its own pipe, its own agent lineage and its own LOCALAPPDATA, the
# product is a throwaway identity in its own directory, and section G measures
# the user's install on every run.
