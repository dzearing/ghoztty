# T1343 acceptance: what a splitter drag COSTS, measured, at several pane
# counts, in both shapes of the frame wait.
#
# THE REPORT THIS EXISTS FOR (user, 2026-09-04): "the windows version is so
# much slower than the mac version. like resizing panes is janky and slow ...
# when I resize panes, they're slow to paint. It feels so unpolished."
#
# THE MECHANISM, because it decides what is measured. One mouse move during a
# divider drag is one `updateDividerDrag` -> `layoutSplitsLive` -> a layout
# pass, all of it on the UI thread, so the wall clock of that call IS the
# drag's frame time. Inside the pass every resized pane blocks on its renderer
# presenting a frame at the new size (`Surface.handleResize`), which is what
# stops DWM stretching stale content across the resize - a real guarantee worth
# keeping. Paid PER PANE it also made the drag degrade with every split: four
# panes meant four 16 ms stalls for one mouse move, about 15 fps of drag.
#
# T1343 collects the panes' frame events during the pass and waits for all of
# them ONCE at the end (`Window.endFrameWaitBatch`), so the guarantee costs one
# frame regardless of pane count. `GHOZTTY_DRAG_SERIAL_WAIT` puts the old
# per-pane wait back, which is what lets this script measure BOTH shapes on one
# build, one box and one afternoon instead of comparing across two builds.
#
# THE ORACLE. The app times its own drag and prints one line per drag at
# `WM_LBUTTONUP` (`Window.reportDragCost`, gated on `GHOZTTY_PERF`), with the
# tick broken into the parts it is actually made of:
#
#   divider drag ticks=.. mean_us=.. max_us=.. mean_wait_us=.. fps=.. panes=..
#                resizes_max=.. waits_max=.. waits_total=.. timeouts=.. stale=..
#                mean_layout_us=.. mean_place_us=.. mean_paint_us=..
#                mean_overlay_us=.. mean_resize_us=.. over_budget=..
#                wait=serial|batched verdict=..
#
# Read from the app rather than photographed from here for the reason
# resize-flicker.ps1 spells out at length: a frame is sub-frame-long and a
# cross-process probe catches it essentially never. The arithmetic behind the
# line (mean/max/fps/verdict, and the two wait ceilings) is pure and asserted
# in every lane by src/apprt/win32/drag_perf.zig.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, and what is only recorded:
#   A. The oracle is live - a drag really reached the handler at every pane
#      count, in both modes, and really moved panes (`resizes/move`).
#   B. THE DEFECT: one mouse move performs ONE frame wait, whatever the pane
#      count. The COUNT is the assertion and the clock is not, because how long
#      a wait costs is a property of the machine (a compositor throttling
#      presents) while how many times the UI thread stopped to wait is a
#      property of the code.
#   C. The shape this replaced really did multiply - 8 waits per move at 8
#      panes - and really did grow with the pane count. Without C, B passes on
#      a build where the frame wait was simply deleted.
#   D. A batched drag holds two frames or better per move, and the drags being
#      compared really ran (tick counts).
#   The absolute numbers for every configuration are printed and written to
#   $env:TEMP\ghoztty-drag-perf\<stamp>\report.txt, which is the "measure
#   first, keep the numbers" half of the task. What they said on 2026-09-04,
#   at 8 panes, on this box: the per-pane shape spent 8.8ms of a 20.0ms move
#   waiting (49 fps); batching it spent 2.6ms of a 15.8ms move (63 fps). The
#   rest is pane placement (9.7ms) and the dim/banner overlay refresh (3.3ms),
#   which is T1345's half of the report and not this fix's.
#
# NOT asserted here: that resizing still shows no stale or stretched content.
# That is `test\win32\resize-flicker.ps1`, which owns the erase/clip oracle and
# runs a posted divider drag of its own; duplicating it here would be a second
# weaker copy of a check that already exists.
#
# Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1) - no foreground
# stolen - and drives the drag with POSTED mouse messages, which is why it
# works there at all (SendInput does not).
#
# -NegativeControl inverts assertion B and MUST fail.
#
