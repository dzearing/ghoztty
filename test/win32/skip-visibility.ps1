#
# Non-interactive. Launches no Ghoztty and touches no user state: the subject is
# the HARNESS, so this reads .ps1 text, runs one pure script and one four-line
# fixture of its own.
#
# Why it exists. `ipc-version.ps1` asserted the About box is a `#32770`
# MessageBox; it has been a native GhozttyConfirmDialog since the T50 chrome
# pass. Every run still printed ALL PASS, because the foreground grab kept
# losing the race and the whole palette section took its SKIP branch instead
# (T217). A skip is legitimate - pwsh is not installed, there is no network, a
# release build compiled the debug oracle out. A skip the RESULT cannot see is
# an un-run assertion wearing a green hat, and go.md reads exactly one line
# (`| Select-Object -Last 1`), so a `(2 section(s) SKIPPED)` line printed above
# the verdict is invisible to the only reader there is.
#
# A: the analyzer catches the shape it exists for, and only that shape.
# B: the sweep - every violator is a named, task-linked exception, and every
#    exception still violates, so the list can only shrink.
# C: the rule on the wire - a real script's last line carries its skip count.
#
# `-TeethCheck` proves section B can go red at all: it drops a real violator off
# the exception list and adds a converted script to it, and the run PASSES only
# if both assertions turn over. A green sweep whose red path nobody has seen is
# the same claim this whole script exists to distrust.
