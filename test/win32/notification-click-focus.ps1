# T448 acceptance: clicking a desktop notification focuses the PANE that
# raised it.
#
# WHAT THIS COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. This script drives the ROUTING half
# of click-to-focus: given that the shell delivered a balloon click, does the
# right pane in the right window end up focused. It posts the tray callback
# (WM_APP_TRAY) into the app's message-only window directly, so it proves the
# handler and everything downstream of it - and, by T240's rule, it therefore
# proves NOTHING about DELIVERY: whether the shell actually sends
# NIN_BALLOONUSERCLICK for our balloon when a human clicks it. A test that
# synthesizes the trigger cannot validate the trigger.
#
# Delivery is the half that was broken, and it is settled elsewhere:
#
#   * By CODE. The balloon icon must ask for Windows 2000-or-later behavior
#     with NIM_SETVERSION or the NIN_* notifications are never sent at all.
#     That call was missing until T448 - see src/apprt/win32/tray_notify.zig,
#     which carries the MSDN quote ("NIM_SETVERSION must be called every time
#     a notification area icon is added") and the reason we register version 3
#     rather than 4.
#   * By MEASUREMENT, as far as it goes: case 6 below reads the app's own log
#     back and fails if the shell ever REFUSED the version registration. A
#     background desktop has no notification area at all, so that check reads
#     differently there - see the case for which half survives where, and for
#     the 2026-08-07 interactive measurement (both calls succeed against the
#     real shell).
#   * By a SECOND SCRIPT, `test\win32\notification-click-real.ps1` (T572),
#     which raises a real balloon, finds the toast the shell drew and clicks it
#     with SendInput. It is interactive-only and not part of the floor, and it
#     SKIPS with the `desktop-toasts` capability named on a box whose
#     Notifications are off - which is the state of the box this suite runs on
#     as of 2026-09-05, so the observation is still owed. Run it after turning
#     Notifications on in Settings > System > Notifications.
#   * By HAND, once, on the interactive desktop, because a balloon renders
#     there and a real click cannot be faked off it:
#
#       zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32 -Doptimize=Debug
#       $env:GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX = '-t448manual'
#       .\zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe
#       # in a pane, from powershell:
#       [console]::Write([char]27 + ']777;notify;Ghoztty;click me' + [char]7)
#       # click somewhere else to background that pane, then click the toast.
#       # PASS = the pane that printed the OSC is focused.
#
# T218 house rules apply: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop
# (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1) so it never takes the user's foreground,
# and only ever touches ghoztty processes from the repo zig-out.
#
# The message-only window is looked up pid-filtered (Find-TestMessageWindow):
# message-only windows are NOT isolated by the test desktop the way top-level
# windows are, so an unfiltered find could hand back the user's own running
# Ghoztty and every post below would drive their terminal.
