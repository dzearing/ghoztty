.SYNOPSIS
    T883 acceptance - no acceptance script may read a capture whose text
    depends on the host it ran under.

.DESCRIPTION
    Four sections:

      A. The BEHAVIOUR the rule exists for, measured live rather than quoted:
         a native command's stderr through `2>&1 | Out-String` arrives as a
         formatted ErrorRecord block whose size tracks the host's buffer
         width, while the same capture stringified per record arrives as the
         command's own text at any width.

      B. The analyzer (`lib\StderrCaptureAudit.ps1`) against fixtures, both
         directions: each host-dependent shape is named, and each of the two
         proven-good shapes yields nothing.

      C. The sweep over `test\win32\*.ps1` and `test\win32\lib\*.ps1`: no
         script may still format a merged stream. `merged-to-file` is
         reported against a ceiling rather than asserted away - most of those
         sites discard to a file nobody reads back.

      D. The regrowth story is WRITTEN DOWN: docs\claude\testing.md names the
         rule, so the harness audit has something to point at.

    `-TeethCheck` proves the section-C assertion can fail: it injects a
    synthesized violator and requires the sweep to go red. Run it after any
    change to the analyzer.

    One `ALL PASS` / `N FAILURE(S)` line last, per the house convention.

.NOTES
    # persistence: launches no GUI and drives no CLI - this scores scripts, it
    # does not run them. The one process it starts is a PowerShell fixture
    # that prints its own buffer width.
    # isolation: none - the `+list` and `+verb` spellings below are FIXTURE
    # TEXT handed to the analyzer as strings; no ghoztty binary is ever run.
