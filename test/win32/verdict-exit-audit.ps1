# verdict-exit-audit acceptance (T221): a script that PRINTS failure EXITS
# failure, and a script that prints success exits success.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\verdict-exit-audit.ps1
#
# Non-interactive. Launches no Ghoztty and touches no user state: the subject is
# the HARNESS, so this reads .ps1 text and runs four small fixtures of its own.
#
# Why it exists. `chooser-menu.ps1` and `host-settings.ps1` ended with a bare
#
#     if ($script:fail -eq 0) { "ALL PASS (...)" } else { "$fail FAILURE(S) (...)" }
#
# and no `exit` anywhere near it, so a run with red assertions fell off the end
# of the script with `$LASTEXITCODE` at 0. `config-errors.ps1` had the identical
# bug (fixed in T217). The summary line was right every time; anything SCORING
# the script by its exit code read a failing run as a pass. All three are fixed,
# so what is left to do is close the CLASS - which is what T221 asked for, in
# its own words: sweep for the shape "rather than trusting the 'no exit 1
# anywhere' search that found these two".
#
# A: the analyzer catches the shapes it exists for, and only those shapes.
# B: the sweep - every acceptance script in test\win32 scores its own verdict.
# C: the rule on the wire - both directions, measured, on real exit codes.
#
# `-TeethCheck` proves section B can go red at all: it synthesizes a violator
# that no exemption covers, and the run PASSES only if the assertion turns over.
# A green sweep whose red path nobody has seen is the same claim this script
# exists to distrust.
