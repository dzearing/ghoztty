# T611 acceptance: clicking Reconnect on a machine whose SESSIONS are gone must
# give the user a working window back, not a dead one.
#
# The case this is about is the ordinary one: a window is running shells on
# another machine, that machine reboots (or its agent restarts), and the pill
# offers Reconnect. The machine is plainly back - the dial succeeds and the
# agent answers - but the shells that were running on it are gone with the
# reboot. Until T611 the driver read that as terminal and left the window dead,
# so the one button whose whole job is "get me back in" answered no in the most
# common real case.
#
# The arms, in the order they are scored:
#
#   C  CONTROL. A remote window with a SPLIT (two panes) comes up over the
#      loopback agent and both panes are LIVE - typed input reaches the child
#      and its output comes back. Scored first and deliberately: without it,
#      arm B proves nothing, because a build that could not open a remote pane
#      at all would leave the same two-pane shape behind.
#   A  AUTOMATIC. The agent is killed and restarted, so the ladder's own retry
#      reaches an agent that owns nothing. It must go TERMINAL and must NOT
#      open fresh shells: replacing a grid the user arranged with empty prompts
#      is only ever allowed when they asked for it.
#   B  MANUAL. The Reconnect button is clicked (the WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN/UP pair
#      Windows posts on HTOBJECT after its own hit test - the handler reads the
#      hit code, not the point, which is what lets this be posted). The window
#      must come back: the SAME split layout, the SAME pane ids, and both panes
#      LIVE on the new transport. Liveness is the load-bearing half - a pane
#      rebuilt as a frozen picture is byte-identical to a working one for every
#      assertion that reads the screen (T532/T652).
#
# TEETH-CHECK: re-run with
#     $env:GHOZTTY_TEST_LIVENESS_BREAK = '1'
# and every Test-PaneLive arm here goes red and nothing else moves.
#
# Runs on a background test desktop with its own pipe suffix and its own agent
# lock, and only ever touches ghoztty processes it started itself.
