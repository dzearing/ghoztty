.SYNOPSIS
    T1133 acceptance - every gate the turn runs has been SHOWN to fail.

.DESCRIPTION
    A check that has never been observed saying anything but "fine" is
    indistinguishable from a check that cannot say anything else, and this
    project has been bitten by that three times in a month:

      * T1099 - `upstream-remote.ps1 ensure` printed UPSTREAM OK every morning
        while answering a weaker question than the one it existed to answer,
        and stayed green through an hour and a half in which every sha it
        guards was `git gc` bait.
      * T783  - the go-loop guard sat 26-red for a day because nothing tied a
        `scripts\go-loop-*.ps1` edit to `test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1`.
      * T1057 - "push after every commit" was a habit for two weeks before it
        was a check, and had to be restated by the user twice.

    The acceptance scripts do not have this problem, and the reason is
    structural: each one carries a `-NegativeControl` (or `-TeethCheck`) mode
    that inverts an assertion so the run MUST score exactly one failure. The
    two gates every turn runs - `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim` and
    `parity-tasks.ps1 validate` - had no equivalent.

    THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES:

        A new gate ships with the demonstration that it can fail, or it is not
        a gate.

    Sections:

      A. The REGISTRY, and its completeness. Every condition label the two gate
         scripts emit is discovered from their source text and must be declared
         here as either a `gate` (a red verdict - needs a demonstration), a
         `hatch` (an escape hatch that must announce itself - also needs one),
         or a `status` (an ordinary informational line). A label nobody has
         triaged fails the section, so a gate added tomorrow cannot ship
         undemonstrated. Every gate/hatch row must then name a harness that
         exists and ASSERTS on that label, and every delegated gate must still
         be reachable from `claim`.
      B. `parity-tasks.ps1 validate`, driven RED here: the seven file-shape and
         graph branches nothing else demonstrated, each against its own fixture
         task dir, plus the positive control that a clean fixture is green and
         silent. B8/B9 cover DEP CYCLE, which T1133 added to `validate` because
         a ring of tasks that wait on each other is otherwise invisible: `next`
         skips every member for "unmet deps" forever and each file reads fine.
      C. `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim`, driven RED here against a throwaway repo -
         stranded work, unpushed work and a broken upstream in one run - plus
         the positive control on a clean, pushed, wired repo. Nothing on the
         live box is touched: the claim runs with `-Repo` pointed at the
         fixture, so its lock, its snapshot and its boot record all land in the
         fixture's own `temp\`.
      D. The rule is WRITTEN DOWN: `go.md` states it and names this harness, so
         the next person adding a gate is told rather than expected to know.

    `-NegativeControl` proves this script can score red at all: it adds one
    inverted assertion that a healthy tree MUST fail, so the run ends with
    exactly one failure.

    Non-interactive. Launches no Ghoztty and touches no user state.

    ASCII-only by design (PS 5.1 on this box mangles non-ASCII on rewrite).
