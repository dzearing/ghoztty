.SYNOPSIS
    T460 - the FIRST crash must yield the stack, with no re-run and no
    reproduction.

.DESCRIPTION
    T450 made a crashed lane produce a stack by re-running the test binary
    under cdb. That only ever describes a crash which obliges by happening
    twice: the occurrence that actually failed the lane yields nothing, and an
    intermittent crash (the one this tooling exists for) is diagnosed by trying
    to provoke it again.

    Windows was already writing the evidence. WER's LocalDumps drops a dump of
    the process at the moment it dies -- unattended, on the first crash, at no
    cost to a run that does not crash -- and nothing read it. This script
    proves the reader, against a REAL access violation raised on a background
    thread, because the load-bearing claim is the same one T450 carries: the
    capture holds the thread that did NOT fault as well as the one that did,
    which zig's own handler can never show.

    It also proves the two ways this path could lie, which matter more than the
    happy path:

      * a dump from an EARLIER crash must never be reported as this one's --
        a wrong stack sends the next investigation where the bug has never been
      * a dump with no exception in it (the T48 freeze watchdog writes those of
        a live, wedged process) must not be read as a crash

.OUTPUTS
    One `ALL PASS` / `N FAILURE(S)` / `ASSERTED NOTHING` line last.
