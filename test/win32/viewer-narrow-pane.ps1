# T1130 acceptance: a viewer pane squeezed narrow keeps every piece of its
# chrome INSIDE the pane.
#
# THE DEFECT, as measured on this box before the fix. A viewer pane dragged to
# 77px (an 800px window, `+rearrange` at ratio 90) still built its
# table-of-contents card at the compact layout's 120 DIP FLOOR - 150px at this
# box's 1.25 scale - so the card's right edge sat 88px past the pane. The card
# is a `WS_CHILD` of the pane host, so Windows clipped it rather than painting
# it over the pane next door: no spill, but a card whose rows, scrollbar and
# rounded right corner were simply cut off, and rows MEASURED for a width the
# card never got.
#
# That is the same shape as the Mac defect 463dcb0b4 fixed one level up
# (`ViewerNarrowPaneTests.swift`): chrome that insists on a minimum width the
# pane cannot pay. Mac's answer - and this script's contract - is that a viewer
# is a leaf in the split tree exactly like a terminal, so the TREE decides the
# width and the leaf compresses to it.
#
# WHY GEOMETRY AND NOT PIXELS. Every piece of viewer chrome on win32 is a child
# window of the pane host (`GhozttyViewerNav` + its `Edit`, `GhozttyViewerTOC`,
# `GhozttyViewerFeedback`), so "inside the pane" is a rect comparison and needs
# no composite, no cursor and no foreground. That is what lets this run on the
# background test desktop, where `CopyFromScreen` and `PrintWindow` are dead
# (lib\TestDesktop.ps1's capture limit).
#
# SECTIONS A-D assert containment of whatever chrome they find, plus a positive
# control that SOMETHING was found, so a run where no chrome exists at all
# cannot score green. Since T1185 the nav bar is part of every viewer pane's
# frame, so it is among what they find in every mode - there is no hover left
# for a background desktop to be unable to perform.
#
# SECTION E measures the narrow bar's LOOK (T1159): `GhozttyViewerNav` answers
# WM_PRINTCLIENT, which is the one capture that works off the input desktop, so
# a control always in the leading slot, a field that is legible or absent,
# nothing gained by narrowing, and a leading mark that visibly changes are all
# assertable here rather than only in the arithmetic the none/win32 lanes cover
# (`viewer_nav_layout.zig`, the `T1130:` and `T1159:` tests, all teeth-checked).
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\viewer-narrow-pane.ps1
#
# SECTION F measures the TOC card's pinned header (T543): it is translucent,
# so scrolling the list under it CHANGES its pixels, where the opaque band it
# replaced never did.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts the narrow-pane containment assertion and section
# F's header claim, and MUST fail with exactly FOUR failures - one per width in
# section B, plus the header - so a run that scores anything else is measuring
# something other than what those assertions name.

    # E. T1159 - the narrow bar looks DESIGNED, not trimmed.
    #
    # The bar is on screen from an .html pane's first layout, with no cursor
    # anywhere in the path (T1185 made that true of every mode) - so the strip
    # is there to look at, its EDIT is a real child window to measure, and the
    # bar answers WM_PRINTCLIENT, which is the one capture that works off the
    # input desktop.
    #
    # What is asserted here is behaviour, not the layout's own arithmetic
    # restated (that is `viewer_nav_layout.zig`'s job, and mirroring it would
    # only prove the mirror). Four claims, all measured:
    #   1. A control is ALWAYS painted in the leading slot, at every width down
    #      to a sliver - that is the "..." overflow taking over from a strip
    #      that no longer fits, and it is why a dropped command is still
    #      reachable.
    #   2. The address field is legible or absent - never a stub. This is the
    #      thing the user flagged as unproven ("1 button and 1 tiny input?").
    #   3. Widening never takes anything away: painted controls and field width
    #      both climb monotonically.
    #   4. The leading slot's mark CHANGES between the widest and the narrowest
    #      pane - a short "..." against a full-height chevron - so the narrow
    #      bar is demonstrably showing the overflow control rather than the
    #      first navigation button with everything after it cut off.
    #
    # The ink scan stops at the address field (T1400). The field is a child
    # EDIT, and whether a child's pixels are in a synchronous PrintWindow
    # capture is a coin flip: the same bar, unmoved, photographed with the
    # field's 35 full-height rows present in one capture and absent in the
    # next, which made the monotone claim above flip verdicts run to run on
    # identical code. What the bar paints ITSELF is deterministic, and it is
    # also the only thing these claims are about.
