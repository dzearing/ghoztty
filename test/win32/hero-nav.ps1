# T126 acceptance: hero-mode key navigation reads the LIVE split tree, moves
# exactly one tile per press, and only ever moves the window it was aimed at.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. Main fixed three hero-navigation defects on the Mac
# that win32 never inherited the CODE for, so the only honest way to close the
# audit is to measure the win32 behavior directly:
#
#   280f2449e - the Mac's key monitor captured the split tree as it was when
#               hero mode was entered, so a pane added afterwards was
#               unreachable and a pane closed afterwards left the selection
#               pointing past the end. (Arms B and C.)
#   280f2449e - the same monitor was app-wide, so one press stepped EVERY
#               window in hero mode and each pulled focus to its own new
#               selection. (Arm D.)
#   4eb13a651 - a focused viewer pane re-injected the chord, so one press
#               stepped TWICE and skipped a pane. (Arm A's one-line-per-press
#               oracle, and arm E.)
#
# win32 has its own implementation (HeroCarousel.zig + hero_math.zig +
# Window.heroSelect), so none of those patches port. What the audit found is
# that the first two hazards are absent BY CONSTRUCTION here - gotoSplit /
# swapSplit / heroSelect read `tab_trees` and `leafCount` live, and a bound
# action is routed through `core_surface.rt_surface.parent_window`, so there is
# no snapshot to go stale and no app-wide monitor to spray. Construction is an
# argument, not evidence; these arms are the evidence.
#
# ARM E is the real defect the audit turned up. `viewer_accel.forwards()` did
# not admit `toggle_hero_mode`, so a focused viewer swallowed ctrl+shift+space
# into the page: with a viewer selected you could navigate the carousel but not
# leave hero mode, on a pane that T397 had already made a full carousel citizen.
#
# THE ORACLES. Two, and they answer different questions:
#   - GEOMETRY: in hero mode exactly ONE leaf is visible, and which HWND that
#     is names the selection. Reading it needs no pixels.
#   - THE DEBUG LOG: `heroSelect req=<asked> clamped=<taken> cur=<from> n=<leaf
#     count>` is emitted once per selection attempt, BEFORE the no-op early
#     return, so a clamped press is visible as a press. `n=` is the live leaf
#     count at the instant of the keystroke, which is what makes arms B and C
#     provable rather than plausible. One line per press is the anti-double-step
#     claim. A release build emits no log; those sub-claims then say so and skip
#     rather than passing vacuously.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts arm A to "the walk SKIPPED a pane", which must fail
# on a healthy build - that is the shape of the Mac's double-step bug.
#
# Runs on the background test desktop. Only touches ghoztty processes running
# from this repo's zig-out*.
