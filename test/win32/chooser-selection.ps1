# Machine-chooser SELECTION TREATMENT acceptance (T828).
#
# The user reported the chooser's selected row as "a bright purple pill with a
# thick purple outline" beside a screenshot of Windows 11 Settings, whose lists
# mark selection with a quiet neutral fill and a small accent bar at the leading
# edge. The row painter now does the same (`chooser_rows.rowPaint`): a neutral
# wash at two weights, the accent spent on ONE 4x16 capsule indicator, and the
# focus rim in neutral ink rather than a second accent ring.
#
# The unit tests in `chooser_rows.zig` assert the model; this script asserts the
# PIXELS, because the defect was never in the numbers - every colour in the old
# treatment cleared its contrast floor and the model tests were green while the
# chooser looked like that. What is measured here:
#
#   B. at open - the list does not hold focus, since the chooser focuses its
#      filter field - the selected row is the DERIVED unemphasized wash of the
#      row background (ColorMath's `Get-Wash`, the same function the Zig side
#      spells `color_math.wash`) and its mark is NEUTRAL, so the accent still
#      means "this is the control you are driving";
#   C. clicking the row moves the list to the emphasized wash and turns the mark
#      into the user's accent, which clears the 3:1 chrome floor against the
#      fill it sits on and is a narrow BAR, not a filled column;
#   D. the pill has no outline in either state: every pixel along its top, right
#      and bottom edges is the fill itself;
#   E. and when Windows says focus visuals are SHOWN (UISF_HIDEFOCUS cleared,
#      which is what keyboard navigation does), the one outline the row is
#      allowed grows inside the pill - the design system's 2.2 focus rim, in
#      NEUTRAL ink rather than a second accent mark.
#
# D is the assertion that would have caught the reported defect (a
# full-perimeter accent border stacked with an accent focus ring), and B/C are
# what keep the fix from drifting back a wash at a time.
#
# C/D and E each PIN the UI-state bit they are claiming about (T988), rather
# than inheriting whatever the harness's own input left behind. D's claim is
# "no outline", the rim IS an outline drawn on purpose, and which one the app
# paints is Windows' call and not the script's - so a section that does not say
# which state it measures is red or green by luck. This one was measured red and
# then green on 2026-08-19 against the same build. (B needs no pin: there the
# list does not hold focus at all, so there is no rim either way.)
#
# The oracles read EDGES and the mark's own column, never a scan for "coloured
# pixels": the row's text is drawn with subpixel antialiasing, whose fringes are
# as saturated as any accent (#80b9ed and #7f5b4e were measured on this fixture's
# own title line), so a chroma scan over the row would score the font renderer.
