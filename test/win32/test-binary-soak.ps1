.SYNOPSIS
    T832 - the soak harness must measure the condition the T443 corruption
    actually occurs in, and say which condition it measured.

.DESCRIPTION
    `scripts\test-binary-soak.ps1` used to do exactly one thing: run a built
    test binary straight out of .zig-cache. On 2026-08-14 that was measured
    against the build runner and found to be a condition the defect has never
    once occurred in -- ~200 direct runs with 0 crashes (including the exact
    binary that had dumped three times that morning) against 5 aborts in 26
    `zig build` lane runs on the same box. Every "it will not reproduce"
    finding T443 ever recorded came out of the wrong condition.

    So this script proves three things, none of which needs a real
    intermittent crash:

    - the DEFAULT for -Lane is the build runner, and the summary names the
      mode it used,
    - the build-runner path classifies PASS / FAIL / CRASH from a staged lane
      (floor-lane.ps1 -Command, the same hook floor-lane grew to make its own
      crash wiring testable), and finds the victim test in the lane log,
    - the standalone path still works, and says in its own output that it is
      the condition T443 has never reproduced in.

    The fixtures are cmd scripts, so a full run is under two minutes and needs
    no zig lane.

.OUTPUTS
    One scored verdict line last (`ALL PASS (N assertions)` / `N FAILURE(S)` /
    `ASSERTED NOTHING`), via test\win32\lib\TestScore.ps1.
