# T1185 acceptance: every viewer pane keeps its address bar on screen.
#
# THE CONTRACT, carried over from Mac's fc7e36356 (which finished what
# 5241d7bec started). The nav bar is part of a viewer pane's FRAME: it is there
# from the pane's first layout in every mode - website, local `.html` page,
# markdown document, code file, diff - with no hover and no cursor anywhere
# near it. There is no peek left to reveal it and no state in which it is
# absent, which is the whole point: the way out of a pane is never something to
# hunt for with the mouse, and nothing reflows when the pointer crosses the top
# edge.
#
# WHY THIS IS MEASURABLE (T1152). The old peek ran behind a `GetCursorPos`
# sample that fails on a background desktop, so a script running there could
# never reveal a bar by hovering - which is why the peek's own half was only
# ever assertable in the unit lanes. With the peek gone the whole contract is
# cursor-free, so all of it is assertable right here.
#
# THE ORACLE is window state, not pixels: the bar is a `GhozttyViewerNav` child
# window of the pane host, so "is it on screen" is `IsWindowVisible` plus a rect
# comparison, and "does it reserve its band rather than cover the page" is the
# WebView2 child's top edge against the bar's bottom. No composite, no
# foreground, no cursor - the three things the background desktop cannot give.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\viewer-nav-pin.ps1
#
# -NegativeControl inverts the PRESENCE assertions (sections A-E): every pane is
# asserted to hide the bar it must show, so a correct build fails all five. A
# build that regressed one mode back to the peek would score that one green,
# which is the shape this control exists to make visible. Anything other than
# five failures means presence is not what is being measured.
