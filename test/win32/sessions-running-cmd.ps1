# T545 acceptance: `+sessions` must name what a PLAIN SHELL session is running.
#
# The gap: the roster's command column comes from `argv`, which is only set for
# a pane opened with an explicit `--command`. Every ordinary pane - the user
# typed their command at the prompt - has `argv == null`, so `+sessions`
# answered nothing at all about what the session was doing. The agent has known
# the answer since T429 (`Session.fg_cmd`, sampled off the shell's most recent
# direct child); it simply never reached the roster.
#
# Scored by OUTCOME - what does the CLI a user runs actually print - not by
# reading the agent's sessions.json:
#
#   A: a live plain-shell session running a long command reports it. The row
#      in `+sessions --json` carries `fg_cmd`, and the human-readable table
#      prints `running=<that command>`. This is also the harness's positive
#      control: it proves the agent is sampling at all on this box, which is
#      what makes B's absence mean something.
#   B: the same session, back at its prompt, reports NOTHING - `fg_cmd` is null
#      and no `running=` appears. Scored only after A passed, because "no
#      command reported" is the answer a build that never sampled would give
#      too, and the two are indistinguishable without A in front of it.
#   C: `argv` and `fg_cmd` stay SEPARATE facts. The row that carries a running
#      command must not have had it written into `argv` - that field is what
#      RELAUNCH re-executes, and overwriting it would make a resumed pane
#      re-run `ping` in place of the shell.
#   D: the pane<->session join ROUND-TRIPS (T552). `+list --json`'s leaf carries
#      `session_id` (pane -> session, T332) and the roster row now carries
#      `pane_id` (session -> pane), and the two must name each other. Scored
#      here because this script is the one place both surfaces are already up
#      over the same live pane, so an agreement failure is the product's and not
#      the harness's. The human table must NOT print the pane id: it is a UUID,
#      and the table is read by eye.
#
# The sampler runs on the store's slow tick (every ~10s), so every assertion
# here polls rather than reading once.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run LOCALAPPDATA, GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN and IPC pipe
