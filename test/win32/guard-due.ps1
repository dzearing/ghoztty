.SYNOPSIS
  Acceptance test for scripts\guard-due.ps1 and its two wirings (T783).

.DESCRIPTION
  guard-due answers ONE question: has anybody run acceptance harness X against
  the code as it now stands? It is a CHANGE gate over a committed stamp, so the
  claims worth measuring are the ones a mtime- or "did this turn touch it"-based
  check would get wrong:

    * a covered file edited and edited BACK is not due (content, not events),
    * a file whose only difference is CRLF-vs-LF or a UTF-8 BOM is not due (a
      gate that fires on a differently-configured clone is a gate nobody reads),
    * a file the row does not cover moving does not make the row due (scope),
    * a covered file that APPEARED or VANISHED is due, not just one that changed.

  Every arm here runs against a fixture repo this script writes itself - the
  real scripts\guard-due.ps1 driven with -Repo <fixture> - so no arm depends on
  what the live tree's stamp happens to say today, and no arm has to dirty the
  real repo to make the gate fire.

  Sections D and E are the ones that matter most, because they measure FORCE
  rather than function: the same staleness must FAIL `parity-tasks.ps1 validate`
  (the pre-commit gate, which is where the remedy is the work this exists to
  cause) and must NOT fail `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim` (a claim that could exit
  nonzero over a stale stamp would wedge the loop, which is the disease and not
  the cure). Both directions are asserted; a gate that only ever reports, and a
  gate that can wedge the loop, are the two ways this feature fails.

  Prints a single ALL PASS / N FAILURE(S) line, like every other script here.

  ASCII-only by design (PS 5.1 on this box mangles non-ASCII on rewrite).

# scripts\loop-session.ps1, the harness itself, and one script the row does not
# cover (the scope control). That control file has a SYNTHETIC name on purpose:
# it used to be `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1`, which was uncovered right up until
# T892 gave the tracker CLI a row of its own - and then three arms here failed
# over a table entry that had nothing to do with them. A name no row can ever
# claim keeps the scope control measuring scope.

    # the vendored asset mirror is byte-identical to tip-of-main. Nothing here
    # changes when main advances, so on 2026-09-02 main rewrote two SKILL.md
    # files, the mirror was stale from that moment, and the guard stayed CURRENT
    # for two days until an unrelated edit to a covered file happened to reopen
    # it. A check that can only go red by accident is the T1099 shape.
    #
    # So a row may also name `Upstream` paths, read out of `origin/main`, whose
    # BLOB shas go in the stamp. Blob rather than head sha: ordinary main churn
    # stays silent, and a change to a file we actually mirror does not.
