# T822 meta-check: the progressive-disclosure docs routing still resolves.
#
# Why: on 2026-08-15 the root CLAUDE.md was split into a small always-loaded
# core plus seven scenario partitions under docs\claude\, and ~18 files that
# cited a CLAUDE.md section by name were repointed at the partition that now
# owns it. Those pointers are the whole navigation model - a source comment
# saying `docs/claude/cli.md "Instance addressability"` is how the next reader
# finds the contract - and NOTHING checked them. Two survived the split
# pointing at CLAUDE.md sections that had moved out of it (a dangling
# `CLAUDE.md "Naming"` in test\win32\window-name-env.ps1 and a dangling
# `CLAUDE.md, "Agent contract & upgrade compatibility"` in
# docs\design\session-persistence.md), and the only thing that found them was a
# human reading the split's validation criteria by hand a day later.
#
# What is checked:
#
#   B  the root routing table's targets all exist on disk
#   C  every `docs/claude/<file>.md` path cited anywhere in the tracked tree
#      resolves to a real file
#   D  every `<doc> "<section>"` citation (doc = CLAUDE.md or a docs\claude
#      partition) names a heading that really is in that doc
#   E  no partition is orphaned - every docs\claude\*.md is routed to from the
#      root CLAUDE.md, so a file nobody can be told to read is a finding
#
# Deliberately NOT checked: prose mentions of CLAUDE.md with no section
# ("CLAUDE.md: the global cache must sit on the repo's drive"). Those name a
# rule rather than a location, they cannot be verified without guessing, and a
# check that guesses is a check that gets ignored.
#
# The parity history files are excluded from the scan (the log, the digests,
# the task/decision/detail/audit files): they are an append-only record of what
# was true on the day it was written, so a path that later moved must NOT
# retroactively turn them red.
#
# Static scan, no app, no CLI - safe on the off-desktop harness.

# A citation is `<doc>[,] "<section>"`, where <doc> is the root CLAUDE.md or one
# of its partitions. Both slash flavors, since scripts and zig comments write
# the Windows one.
#
# Two shapes the naive form got wrong, both measured against the real tree:
#
#  * A long citation WRAPS - over a comment block behind a `//!` / `///` / `#`
#    marker in source, or over bare prose in a markdown paragraph. The section
#    may therefore cross ONE newline, marker or not; a heading short enough to
#    cite never wraps twice, and bounding it at one keeps a stray quote from
#    swallowing the rest of a file.
#  * `"== S8.6: ... per docs/claude/cli.md"` in a PowerShell script ends a
#    STRING right after the path, and the naive pattern read that terminator as
#    the opening quote of a section running to the next quote three lines down.
#    A real citation always separates the path from the quote with a space or a
#    comma, so requiring that separator drops the whole false-positive class.
