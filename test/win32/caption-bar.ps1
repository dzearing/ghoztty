# T254 acceptance: the window draws its OWN caption bar.
#
# Until T254 every window was a plain WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW and the caption -
# title, minimize, maximize, close - was drawn by DWM, in the non-client area,
# in another process's composition pass. T78/T203 only ever asked DWM to
# restyle its own caption (DWMWA_CAPTION_COLOR & co.), which is not the same
# thing as owning it: there was no DC to draw a button into. WM_NCCALCSIZE now
# hands the caption band to the CLIENT area, which is what makes T234's "..."
# button and T205's in-titlebar tabs possible at all.
#
# That change also makes the caption TESTABLE for the first time: it is client
# pixels now, so PrintWindow captures it. The DWM caption it replaces never
# appeared in a capture at all.
#
# What this script asserts, and how:
#
#   1. The band is OURS. The client area's top edge is the window's top edge
#      (NCCALCSIZE consumed the frame's caption), and a column down the middle
#      of the window is chrome-colored for exactly the native 32 DIP caption
#      height (T496) before it turns into terminal background. Scanned, not
#      assumed - the first non-chrome row IS the measured band height.
#   2. The buttons PAINT where caption_layout.zig says they do: a bright
#      glyph pixel at the center of each native 46 DIP slab and of the "..."'s
#      square, bare chrome at rest on the slabs (native buttons light only on
#      hover/press), and the GROUP gap between the "..." and the minimize slab
#      is plain chrome (which is what catches a cluster laid out at the wrong
#      scale - a button would smear across it).
#   2b. The private restatement of the caption run's four x's AGREES with
#      lib\ChromeGeometry.ps1's published ones (T264). See CaptionGeom's header
#      for why the restatement is kept rather than deleted.
#   3. WM_NCHITTEST answers correctly, INCLUDING HTMAXBUTTON. That code is not
#      decoration: the Snap Layouts flyout is triggered by the OS watching for
#      it, so a maximize button that answers HTCLIENT silently deletes a
#      Windows 11 feature. This is a real SendMessage - the same question
#      Windows itself asks - not a synthesized answer.
#   4. Each button ACTS: minimize iconifies, maximize/restore toggles, close
#      closes. Driven with the WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN/UP pair Windows sends after
#      its own hit test.
#   5. Press-then-slide-off CANCELS. A press on close released over minimize
#      must not close the window - the thing every native button does, and the
#      thing that makes a mis-aimed close recoverable.
#   6. Maximized, the caption is ON SCREEN. This is the classic custom-titlebar
#      bug: without the SM_CYSIZEFRAME + SM_CXPADDEDBORDER inset in
#      WM_NCCALCSIZE the whole button row sits above the monitor's top edge,
#      the window looks perfectly fine, and the controls are simply
#      unreachable.
#
# LIMIT, stated rather than glossed: sections 4-5 click at a POINT and let the
# harness route it - since T263 Send-TestMouse asks the window the same
# WM_NCHITTEST Windows asks and posts the message family that answer names, so
# the hit code is no longer hand-picked here and a button that MOVED now fails
# these sections. What is still synthesized is the delivery itself: these are
# posted messages, not a real pointer (T240's lesson - a script that
# synthesizes the trigger cannot validate the trigger). The part that cannot be
# faked at all is sections 1-2: those are PAINTED pixels from a live window,
# and the caption band does not exist unless WM_NCCALCSIZE actually worked.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: -NegativeControl inverts section 1's band-height assertion
# (asserts the band is ABSENT, i.e. the window's top row is already terminal
# background) and MUST fail.

# Where the caption's controls are, in this window, right now: the system trio
# is three NATIVE 46 DIP slabs flush to the client's right edge with zero gaps
# (T496), and T234's "..." is the app's 28 DIP square one GROUP step (pad_md)
# left of the minimize slab. Same arithmetic as caption_layout.layout,
# deliberately restated from the DIP constants rather than read out of the
# binary - section 2 is what checks that derivation against real pixels.
#
# T264 - WHICH WAY THIS WENT, AND WHY. `lib\ChromeGeometry.ps1` publishes these
# same four x's (`CaptionCloseLeft`/`CaptionMaxLeft`/`CaptionMinLeft`/
# `CaptionOverflowLeft`, added in T260), so from T260 on this was the SECOND
# derivation of one datum in one test tree - the exact shape T257 spent a task
# deleting four times over. The choice was to read them out of the module and
# keep one hand-written cross-check, or to keep the restatement and assert it
# AGREES. Kept, and asserted (section 2b):
#
#   * The cross-check is the whole reason the copy exists. Section 2 measures
#     PAINTED pixels against these numbers, and if the numbers came from the
#     module then a module that drifted would move the probe points with it and
#     keep passing - the derivation would no longer be checked by anything.
#   * A restatement that is never compared is a latent divergence (T256: a
#     script measuring last release's layout and reporting a healthy product as
#     broken). Comparing it turns the duplicate into an oracle, which is the
#     one form of duplication that pays for itself.
#
# So: this function stays hand-derived from the DIP constants, and section 2b
# fails loudly the moment it and the module disagree by even a pixel.

# measured from the RIGHT edge, so a stale window rect aims every click at the

    # --- 4h. and a HOVER lights it too, read off a hovered frame (T786) ------
    # The press below is a fine oracle for the press, and it was standing in
    # for the hover only because a hover could not be photographed: a posted
    # WM_MOUSEMOVE cannot survive to the paint it dirties on a background
    # desktop - TrackMouseEvent watches the REAL cursor, so WM_NCMOUSELEAVE is
    # posted within a frame and WM_PAINT is the lowest-priority message in the
    # queue, so the leave is always drained first (T209/T233). `caption_pressed`
    # was the state that happened to survive that leave, which is why section 4
    # reached for it. It is not the same claim: `handleNcMouseLeave` clears the
    # HOVER and deliberately keeps the PRESS, so a build whose hover state or
    # hover fill stopped working entirely would sail through the press arm.
    #
    # T282's `Get-TestHoverCapture` has the APP hit-test, SEND the move, repaint
    # and PrintWindow on ONE GUI-thread stack that the message loop is never
    # reached in the middle of, so the leave cannot interleave. It routes the
    # NON-client twin of the move when the point hit-tests non-client - which
    # these slabs do (section 3 just proved HTMINBUTTON) - so this exercises
    # WM_NCMOUSEMOVE -> `handleNcMouseMove` -> `caption_hover`, the chain the
    # real pointer walks.
    #
    # The numbers are the paint rule, not a measured constant:
    # `icon_button.fillDelta` shades a dark chrome by +15 for `hover` and +25
    # for `pressed`, so the band's 20 becomes 35 hovered and 45 pressed. The
    # assertion is therefore a BAND - lit, but not as firm as a press - which
    # is what catches a hover that silently paints the pressed treatment.

    # --- 5. the ACTIONS ------------------------------------------------------
    # A caption button's job ends at posting WM_SYSCOMMAND; whether the window
    # then minimizes is DefWindowProc's business, not ours. This section used
    # to be guarded by an ABORT and SKIPPED wholesale, because a plain
    # WM_CLOSE - which has nothing to do with T254 - sometimes did not close
    # the window here, and the desktop was blamed for it.
    #
    # T255 measured it: nothing about the desktop is involved. The window was
    # DISABLED, by the app's own close-confirmation dialog. ConfirmDialog.show
    # calls EnableWindow(owner, FALSE) for the length of its message loop, and
    # DefWindowProc discards every WM_SYSCOMMAND for a disabled window - so
    # SC_MINIMIZE/SC_MAXIMIZE/SC_CLOSE become no-ops while it is up, and a
    # second WM_CLOSE only re-enters confirmCloseIfNeeded and raises another.
    # Hit testing and painting keep working throughout, which is what made it
    # look like a wedge instead of a block. On the interactive desktop you
    # would simply see the dialog; here nobody does.
    #
    # So the control still runs FIRST (it is destructive, and a relaunched
    # window carries the assertions), but a window that does not close is now
    # INTERROGATED rather than treated as an unknowable desktop: the one thing
    # that can block it is named, answered, and reported as a failure. This
    # window's shell is an idle cmd.exe with no descendants, so
    # confirmCloseIfNeeded should not prompt at all - a dialog here is a
    # finding about the product, not a reason to stop testing.
