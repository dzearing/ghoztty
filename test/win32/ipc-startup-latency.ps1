# T188 acceptance: the app must ANSWER IPC while it is still restoring, not
# only after.
#
# THE DEFECT. An IPC request is never served by the listener thread that
# accepted it - `IpcServer.listen` posts WM_APP_IPC to the message-only window
# and blocks on the request's `done` event until the GUI thread runs the
# handler. `App.run` called `restoreSessionLayout()` straight through before the
# message loop and pumped nothing while it did, so for the whole restore a
# client connected and then waited: measured 451 ms for a healthy 5-pane
# restore and 10 755 ms against an agent SUSPENDED across the relaunch. To a
# caller - the upgrade script that reported this, or any agent tooling - that is
# indistinguishable from "no running Ghoztty instance".
#
# THE ORACLE, and why it is a real one. `+list --json` answers with the windows
# that exist RIGHT NOW, so a startup that answers early answers with FEWER
# windows than it ends up with. Each arm therefore records two numbers from one
# polling loop:
#
#   t_answer  - elapsed to the first `+list --json` that parses at all
#   t_window  - elapsed to the first one that reports >= 1 window
#
# Before the fix those two collapse onto each other: nothing answers until the
# restore is done, by which point the windows are there. After it they separate,
# and the gap IS the interval that used to be a blackout. Arm C is the
# load-bearing one because the suspended agent makes that interval seconds wide;
# arm B's healthy restore is a few hundred milliseconds by nature, so it is
# scored on a ceiling rather than on a gap it cannot reliably show.
#
# Timing is measured from the moment the app process is started, with the poll
# loop issuing `+list` back-to-back and no sleep between attempts, so the
# resolution is one CLI startup (~150 ms) - far finer than the seconds these
# arms discriminate.
#
# Runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop so it never takes the user's foreground;
# hermetic via a per-run LOCALAPPDATA + GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN + a private IPC
# pipe suffix, and it only ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched
# from the repo zig-out.
