# T202 acceptance: the tab strip's geometry, shape and selection idiom.
#
# The strip used to hand the LAST tab all the remaining width, so a single tab
# spanned the whole window - which flung the close button to the far edge,
# jammed the "+" against the tab, and stretched the selected-tab accent into a
# full-width blue rule under the strip. That rule is gone: a tab NEVER takes
# the remainder. The selected tab is a rounded-top chiclet filled with the
# CONTENT background (WinUI TabView's selection cue - no underline), the "+"
# travels with the last tab and the "=" menu button stays pinned right, with a
# real gap between the groups.
#
# T235 replaced the other half of that rule. A tab used to be its equal share
# of the strip clamped to [60, 200] DIP, and the 200 truncated titles while
# most of the strip sat empty (". Fix background p..." on a wide window). A tab
# is now its OWN CONTENT's width, floored at 60 DIP and capped at 50% OF THE
# TAB RUN - a proportion of the container, not a DIP constant - and falls back
# to the equal share only when the preferred widths do not all fit. So this
# script derives its expectations from the MEASURED tab and the measured run;
# the only place 200 DIP still appears is section 7, as the retired constant a
# long title must now be allowed to exceed.
# Measured target: docs/design/win32-tab-strip.md. Geometry: tab_strip_layout.zig.
#
# One hermetic GUI launch (--config-default-files=false, black background,
# --window-show-tab-bar=always so a SINGLE tab still shows the strip - the
# configuration the user screenshotted):
#   1. DPI scale from the window itself -> every DIP constant, including the
#      caption band T254 moved into the client area; the strip's height is then
#      the REMAINDER between that band and the pane child's top, so a wrong
#      caption offset fails loudly instead of skewing every measurement (T256).
#   2. A scanline near the BOTTOM of the strip (below the title baseline) is
#      pure content-black inside the selected chiclet and bar-gray outside it,
#      so one row of pixels yields the selected tab's exact extent.
#   3. That extent is the oracle for tab COUNT too: the selected chiclet's
#      left edge is strip_pad + (index * tab_w), so a click that creates a tab
#      moves it right by exactly one tab width, and a click that creates
#      nothing leaves it put.
#
# T218: migrated onto the BACKGROUND test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1),
# so it never takes the user's foreground - asserted here, not assumed. This
# script was already captured with PrintWindow, which is exactly the capture
# path that survives off the input desktop (the tab strip is GDI-painted
# CHROME - the half of the CAPTURE LIMIT that migrates), so the pixel oracle is
# unchanged. T941 moved it to the SYNCHRONOUS form (-Sync): the window paints
# the strip into the harness's DC before the call returns, instead of the
# harness reading whatever DWM had composited by then. What T218 changed:
#
#   * Clicks are POSTED at the TOP-LEVEL window, which is what paints and
#     hit-tests the strip. SetCursorPos + mouse_event is refused off the input
#     desktop.
#   * ctrl+t goes through Send-TestKeys, re-resolving the focused surface every
#     time: each new tab is a NEW GhozttyTerminal child, and a chord posted at
#     the previous one is silently dropped (T218 batch 1).
#   * The cursor parking is gone. It existed so no tab painted a hover fill,
#     and a background desktop has no pointer over the window at all.
#   * The menu window is found with Get-TestWindow (desktop-scoped), not
#     FindWindowW, which searches the caller's desktop and would never see it.
#   * Every capture is guarded by Get-TestDistinctColors: a window captured
#     mid-paint comes back solid black, and solid black reads as "the chiclet
#     spans everything" AND "no accent pixels anywhere" - one false FAIL and
#     one false PASS from the same bad frame.
#
# T209 added the APPEARANCE layer these geometry assertions never had -
# section 2e (the glyphs sit on one frame, each centered in its square),
# section 4b (the tab silhouette: inactive surface, gap, gradient rim, flare,
# antialiasing) and section 4c (the close "x" hot-tracks and acts where it
# paints). Both source-level controls were WIDENED to cover them, because both
# were claiming more than they did: T204_NEUTERED left every glyph exactly
# where the shipped build puts it (`glyphCentered()` was consumed by nobody),
# and T206_NEUTERED left the flare and the antialiasing on.
#
#   * T204_NEUTERED (icon_button.zig) - centering fails; expect section 2b's
#     "+ left and bottom gaps" to fail WITH it, since that gap is measured
#     from the mark and the control is what moves the mark.
#   * T206_NEUTERED (tab_shape.zig) - the four section-4b shape assertions
#     fail; nothing in 1-3 or 5-7 does.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: -NegativeControl inverts the single-tab-width assertion
# (asserts the tab DOES span the client width) and MUST fail. The deeper
# source-level control still stands for the geometry claims: flip T202_NEUTERED
# in src/apprt/win32/tab_strip_layout.zig to `true`, rebuild
# `-Dapp-runtime=win32`, re-run - the single-tab-width, the 50%-of-the-run cap
# and the last-tab->"+" gap assertions must fail; the accent-rule and
# click/hit-test assertions must not. (T235 changed WHAT bounds a tab's width,
# not the neuter: the neuter restores "last tab takes the remainder", which is
# still the rule the cap assertions catch.)
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out.
# -DebugMarker re-enables the win32 debug chrome marker (an amber tab bar)
# after the harness disables it. T363: every claim this script makes about
# a chrome color is scored against a pixel of the SAME surface, never
# against a literal channel range, so an amber bar has to pass exactly the
# way the dark one does. That is the run which proves it - a switch rather

    # 6. The right-anchored button is pinned to the right END OF THE STRIP -
    #    its PAINTED square inset by the same padding the first tab gets on the
    #    left, not flush against the window border ("the hamburger button has
    #    no gap between it and the border"). Its hit box is allowed to reach
    #    into that pad (T232: a forgiving click target is free precisely
    #    because it is invisible), so the miss is asserted at the outermost
    #    pixel column - past the hit box, which no amount of forgiveness may
    #    cross.
    #
    #    WHICH button that is depends on the window (T260). This one draws its
    #    own caption, so the caption's "..." hosts the menu and the strip's "="
    #    is not painted at all: the "+" inherits the slot, and section 5 has
    #    just filled the strip, so it is sitting at its limit. The assertion is
    #    therefore that the right-most square opens a TAB and NO menu - which
    #    is a stronger statement than the old one, because it fails both if the
    #    inset is wrong and if the retired "=" came back.
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    #    Two oracles, because since T263 a click at that column is not even
    #    the strip's to decline: the merged row hands its right end to the
    #    caption, so the window itself routes it away as a non-client hit
    #    (asserted first, from the app's own WM_NCHITTEST). The click is then
    #    delivered in the CLIENT form on purpose - the message the strip's own
    #    handler reads - so "the hit box stops short of the border" is still
    #    measured against the strip rather than assumed from the routing.
