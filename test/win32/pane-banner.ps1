# T35/T91 acceptance: sticky pane banner — `+set-banner` IPC, OSC 7778,
# banner overlay strip on the glass, `+list` additive `banner` field, the
# ctrl+shift+b "Set Pane Banner" editor dialog, and the T91 markdown
# parity blocks (headings, rules, tables, native checkboxes, collapse).
#
# T217 batch 8: runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1), so
# it never steals the user's foreground.
#
# Oracles:
#   - `+list --json` panes carry an additive `banner` field with the raw
#     markdown source when set (absent otherwise).
#   - A visible GhozttyBannerOverlay popup is glued ABOVE the pane (its
#     bottom meets the pane HWND's top — T101: the strip band is reserved
#     by the window layout, so the grid starts below the banner, never
#     under it) and spans the pane width; its height grows with `\n` line
#     breaks (capped at 10 display lines). Setting/clearing/collapsing a
#     banner moves the pane top by exactly the strip height.
#   - A pixel probe inside the strip reads the card wash rather than the dark
#     pane background while the banner is up (proves the strip reaches the
#     glass, not just the data model).
#   - T131 (glass card): the banner is a FLOATING CARD, not a full-width
#     strip. The band's own corners read the pane background EXACTLY (the
#     card is inset by a uniform margin and nothing behind the band bleeds
#     through — that see-through was the "text scrolls behind the banner"
#     report), the card interior is the Mac wash `white @ 6%` over the pane
#     background, an elevation shadow darkens the band just under the card,
#     and the popup is fully OPAQUE.
#   - A heading is taller than a plain line; an `---` rule line is thinner
#     than a text line; a pipe table renders 3 display rows from 4 source
#     lines (the separator row never renders).
#   - A checked task-list box paints real green pixels (native box), not
#     a plaintext glyph.
#   - A multi-line banner collapses to a first-line sliver on click and
#     expands back on a second click — and every animated frame of BOTH
#     directions is really painted, so an expand never leaves a stale
#     half-open card sitting in the band (T833).
#   - T165 (link affordance): a link's underline is DOTTED at rest and goes
#     SOLID under the pointer (measured as ink-over-span on the rule's own
#     row, so it needs no pixel constant); a right-click on a link opens the
#     Mac-parity action menu with the left-click default as its first row;
#     and Ctrl+click really opens a viewer side pane, read back from
#     `+list --json` rather than from a pixel.
#   - OSC 7778 emitted from inside the pane round-trips into +list.
#   - The editor dialog (GhozttyBannerDialog) opens on ctrl+shift+b, is modal
#     over its window, arrives prefilled and selected, commits on ctrl+enter,
#     cancels on Escape.
#
# CAPTURE, on the test desktop: every pixel probe here reads the BANNER
# OVERLAY's own GDI chrome, which is the half of the CAPTURE LIMIT that
# migrates — PrintWindow returns the real painted card (measured: 64 distinct
# colors, card wash 30,30,34, band corner 16,16,20, shadow 12,12,15). None of
# them touch the OpenGL terminal surface, which would come back a flat fill.
# Each capture is still guarded with Get-TestDistinctColors: a window captured
# mid-paint is solid black, and black satisfies a "was anything drawn?" probe
# while proving nothing (T216).
#
# OPACITY, on the test desktop: the pre-migration oracle for "the card is
# fully opaque" was `composited screen pixel == own-DC pixel`, and there is no
# screen composite off the input desktop to compare against. It is replaced by
# the attribute that DECIDES the composite — GetLayeredWindowAttributes must
# report alpha 255 with LWA_ALPHA and no colour key — plus the unchanged
# band-corner probe, which is what a translucent strip actually failed.
# Relabelling a single capture as "composited == own" instead would have been
# a vacuous assertion (T217 batch 3).
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.

    # The user's report: a path printed into a banner by a tool did nothing
    # when clicked, because only [label](target) ever became a link here -
    # win32 had no autolink pass at all. Mac autolinks bare paths and URLs;
    # this is that pass, with the Windows-native spellings added.
    #
    # Three oracles, all of them BINARY and none of which launches anything
    # on the user's box:
    #   * the right-click MENU: a menu opens at all only over a link, and its
    #     first row is by contract the left-click default - so "Reveal in
    #     File Explorer" IS the promise that a plain click reveals the file
    #     rather than opening it.
    #   * Ctrl+click, end to end: a viewer pane pointed at that exact path,
    #     which proves the TARGET carried the whole path, backslashes and all.
    #   * the negative control, the other direction: the same text with its
    #     drive prefix removed opens NO menu at the same spot. The sigil IS
    #     the signal, and prose must never sprout links.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT a pixel count of link-colored ink, which is what this
    # section tried first: ClearType fringes put a few blue-dominant pixels
    # on the edge of every glyph, so plain text scored 393 "link" px against
    # a real link's 2413 and the two could not be told apart by a threshold
    # that would survive a font or theme change. 6i's rule-row oracle is the
    # one that works in pixels, and it is already asserted there.
