# T1231 meta-check: no repository text file holds a control character, and the
# check that says so has teeth.
#
# Why: on 2026-09-01 fifteen tracked files were carrying REAL control bytes
# where a Windows path had been written with a backslash escape - some tool
# interpreted `\a`, `\b` and `\f` on the way in and wrote 0x07, 0x08 and 0x0c
# into the file. `zig-out\bin` became `zig-out<0x08>in`; `scripts\floor-lane.ps1`
# became `scripts<0x0c>loor-lane.ps1`; and in scripts\guard-due.ps1's coverage
# table `src\apprt\win32\install_prepare.zig` became `src<0x07>pprt\...`, so that
# guard row could never resolve the file it claimed to cover and nobody could
# see why by looking.
#
# That is the exact shape a check should own: trivially detectable, and
# impossible to see by eye. A reader sees the two halves of the path run
# together and files it as a typo; a script sees a path that quietly does not
# exist and reports it as not-found.
#
# THE RULE. In a tracked file whose extension is in scripts\control-char-scan.ps1's
# allowlist, any byte below 0x20 other than tab / LF / CR - and DEL (0x7f) - is a
# finding. The allowlist is what keeps the libghostty fuzz corpora (extensionless
# fixtures whose whole point is to hold control bytes) out of scope without an
# exclusion list that has to be argued with.
#
# Sections:
#
#   A  the scanner itself bites (synthetic fixtures, both directions)
#   B  the live tree is clean
#   C  the fifteen repaired files hold the path they were MEANT to hold, not
#      merely a printable one
#   D  the gate is wired: parity-tasks.ps1 validate asks the scanner, and the
#      pre-commit hook asks it about staged files
#
# Static scan, no app, no CLI - safe on the off-desktop harness.
