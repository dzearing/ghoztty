# T145 acceptance: IN-PLACE local-agent crash recovery.
#
# The defect: when the local ghoztty-agent dies while the GUI stays up, every
# persistent pane is frozen — its PTY went with the agent and the app's shared
# connection is dead. Before T145 the panes stayed dead until the user quit and
# relaunched, which is the exact failure session persistence exists to prevent.
#
# Measured by OUTCOME, never by log scraping:
#
#   A: baseline — a 2-pane window, both panes agent-backed and RESPONSIVE
#      (a marker typed in and read back), with the app pid and shell pids
#      recorded.
#   B: kill ONLY the agent. The app process must still be the SAME pid and must
#      still answer IPC — that is what makes this "in place" rather than a
#      relaunch. This section also proves the trap is ARMED: with the agent
#      gone, the panes are genuinely broken before recovery is asserted.
#   C: recovery — within the settle window + re-dial, the window is back to 2
#      panes and BOTH ARE RESPONSIVE AGAIN (a fresh marker round-trips). The
#      shell pids are UNCHANGED: since T909 every session is holder-backed by
#      default, so the children outlive the agent and the replacement ADOPTS
#      them (T906) instead of relaunching. Until then the same assertion read
#      the other way round — new pids, because the shells died with the agent —
#      and the flip is the whole user-visible point of T705. What separates a
#      real rebuild from a pane that merely still exists is the SURFACE set
#      (E7), never the pids.
#   D: the e65cfa4d5 lesson — recovery must not KILL the sessions it recovers.
#      The alive-session count is 2 after recovery AND still 2 after the
#      departing surfaces have had time to finish tearing down (their DETACH
#      must never have been a CLOSE).
#   E: topology is preserved, not flattened: still one window, one tab, a split
#      of exactly two leaves, and the pane's registered IPC name still resolves.
#   G: T195 - the other half of the policy, and the one that keeps recovery from
#      being destructive: a link BLIP must be a no-op. The agent is SUSPENDED
#      until the app says it has started its settle watch, then RESUMED well
#      inside the 5s window, and nothing may move - same terminal surfaces, same
#      children, same sessions, same responsive pane.
#   H: the negative control for G - the identical blip HELD past the window, which
#      must rebuild. One variable between the two sections: how long the link
#      stayed down.
#   I: T723 - the blip held past the RE-DIAL, so recovery ABORTS (a wedged agent
#      holds the single-instance guard and never completes a handshake), and then
#      the wedged agent is KILLED. Nothing but a retry can save those panes: the
#      settle watch never re-opens, because a link already in `reconnecting`
#      produces no further DOWN edge. They must come back with no app relaunch.
#   J: the same abort, ended by a RESUME instead of a kill - the softer half,
#      where a healed link is also an acceptable cure. The panes must be
#      responsive either way.
#   K: T764 - the OTHER pane, the one opened while the agent is wedged. It must
#      fall back to a plain exec pane and WORK, instead of inheriting the stuck
#      shared connection and opening frozen, and the window must still open
#      promptly rather than blocking on a handshake that never completes.
#
# The oracle for "did a rebuild run" is the set of GhozttyTerminal child windows,
# not the child pids. Recovery keeps the window HWND and replaces the SURFACES
# inside it, so a fresh set is positive proof a rebuild ran and an unchanged set
# is positive proof none did. Sections E7 and H6 take that same measurement where
# a rebuild IS expected, which is what makes G's "nothing changed" a claim rather
# than a tautology.
#
# Fully hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA and GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN, and
# it ONLY ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched from the repo

# --- T195: suspend/resume a process, and enumerate the app's pane surfaces ---
#
# SUSPENDING is how a link BLIP is induced with no new test hook and no
# debugger: a frozen agent answers no heartbeats, so the app's transport FSM
# walks to `reconnecting` exactly as it does for a real drop
# (`remote/connection.zig` §5.1, 3 missed heartbeats at 3s), and a resume puts it
# back on the very next authentic packet.
#
# ENUMERATING is the outcome oracle. In-place recovery keeps the window HWND and
# replaces the surfaces inside it (`rebuildTabLeavesInPlace` ->
# `replaceTabLeaf`), so the tab's `GhozttyTerminal` child windows are a fresh set
# after a rebuild and the same set after a no-op.
#
# Child PIDS deliberately are NOT the oracle here, and that is a correction to
# the plan T195 was filed with. They cannot answer a SUSPEND: a frozen agent
# never loses a child, so a rebuild after a blip would re-ATTACH the very same
# pids and read as "nothing happened". Since T909 they cannot answer a KILL
# either - holder-backed sessions survive it and are adopted, so the pids are
# unchanged there too. The surface set separates the two cases under either
# stimulus, which is why it is the oracle and the pids are only evidence about
# the SHELLS.

# Section H resumes the agent as soon as the app says it is recovering, so the
# re-dial always lands on a running agent. THIS section holds the suspend
# through the re-dial, which is the branch nothing had ever measured: the agent
# is alive (so its single-instance guard blocks a replacement) and its pipe
# accepts a connection the handshake never completes, so `findOrSpawn` spends
# its whole budget and `recoverLocalAgentInPlace` ABORTS.
#
# What made that abort terminal before T723: the settle watch only opens on a
# link DOWN EDGE, and `Connection` fires its observer only on a real state
# CHANGE. The link is already `reconnecting` by then and its only remaining
# transition is to `dead`, which needs a server-sent DETACHED frame - which a
# wedged (or killed) agent never sends. So no second edge ever arrived, nothing
# re-armed the watch, and the panes stayed frozen until the app was relaunched.
#
# This arm is the WORST case, and the one with no other cure at all: after the
# abort the wedged agent is KILLED while still frozen, so there is no healed link
# to fall back on. Its death produces no new down edge either (the link is
# already `reconnecting`, and a dead pipe only re-signals a transport error,
# which is not a state CHANGE), so the retry is the only thing that can bring
# these panes back.
#
# Order matters between this section and J: each arm must start on a
# freshly-healthy agent. A wedge held long enough for the agent's OWN
# single-instance guard to go stale (`single_instance.heartbeat_stale_after_ms`,
# 45s) lets the app's spawned challenger kill and replace the holder, at which
# point recovery succeeds on its first try and the abort under test never
# happens. Both arms reach their verdict ~15s into the wedge, well inside that,
# but only if the agent they suspend has been heartbeating normally - which is
# why the kill arm runs FIRST and hands J a brand-new agent, rather than J
# inheriting one this section has already frozen.
