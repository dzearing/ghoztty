# T452 - the WHEA report reads a noisy box as noisy.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-08-04, T449 asked whether this box was faulting,
# queried Microsoft-Windows-WHEA-Logger filtered to Error LEVEL, got nothing
# back, and recorded "zero WHEA events in 14 days" as evidence of healthy
# hardware. There were 6369 of them in that window - all Warning level, because
# a CORRECTED hardware error is logged as a warning. A month later the same
# query answers 8020.
#
# So the thing under test is not "does the script run". It is: does a window
# containing nothing but Warning-level corrected errors get REPORTED, does an
# uncorrected one score differently from a corrected one, and does an event id
# the table has never seen get named rather than folded into silence.
#
# The classification arms run off JSON fixtures so they are deterministic on any
# box; the live arms only assert the shape of a real run, since what the real
# event log holds is whatever it holds.
