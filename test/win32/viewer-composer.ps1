# T934 acceptance: the feedback composer's WEB surface.
#
# The composer's text rect stopped being a RichEdit and became a second
# `ICoreWebView2Controller` hosting our own contenteditable page (D43's answer).
# This script is that surface's acceptance; `test\win32\viewer-feedback.ps1`
# keeps proving the EDITING semantics against the RichEdit fallback it pins
# itself to, because window messages cannot drive a Chromium window from the
# background test desktop.
#
# What is asserted:
#
#   A. opening the composer creates a WEB surface -- the pane says
#      `viewer feedback composer surface=web`, not one of the `richedit(...)`
#      degrades.
#   B. the page LOADED: `viewer composer ready` means NavigateToString took the
#      document, the engine parsed it, and its script ran far enough to post.
#   C. the round trip WORKS in both directions: the host seeded the page from
#      the pane's buffer and the page read its own document back and pushed a
#      snapshot up -- `viewer composer echo pane=<id> bytes=0 lines=1` for an
#      empty composer. Nothing else outside the process can see that channel.
#   D. the view is a real child of the band, sized inside it -- i.e. the
#      controller's bounds were set from the pill's text rect rather than left
#      at 0x0.
#   E. closing the composer GIVES THE RENDERER BACK (D43's own mitigation):
#      the controller is destroyed and its window tree goes with it.
#   F. reopening builds a new one, loads, and echoes again -- the lazy
#      create/destroy cycle is repeatable rather than a one-shot.
#   G. the band is still exactly the height the pane reserved for it, so the
#      swap did not move the geometry.
#
# ORACLES. This runs on the background test desktop, where CopyFromScreen and
# SendInput are dead (T233), so nothing here looks at a painted caret. Two
# things are readable and both are the real thing:
#
#   * the controller's window tree is REAL windows, so its existence, its
#     parentage and its rect are ordinary window-helper reads.
#   * the composer states every step of its own lifecycle in stderr, and the
#     `echo` line is a number the PAGE produced -- a value that cannot exist
#     unless the document loaded, the seed arrived and the snapshot came back.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT assert: typing. A posted WM_CHAR does not
# reach a Chromium renderer, and there is no input desktop here. The typing
# path is proven in-process instead, by the `host floor` test in
# `ViewerPane.zig`, which drives a real controller through open, seed, quote,
# send and a report on disk.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
