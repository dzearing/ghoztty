# A delivery to install locations 2 and 3 must be MEASURED, not asserted (T198).
#
# The standing bar is that a user-facing fix reaches all three install
# locations. Only the installed release has ever been scripted; the Desktop
# portable, the network share, the share's loose agent and the portable ZIP were
# re-derived from prose in the session log every time. Two measurements say what
# that costs:
#
#   * T196 (2026-07-30) hand-built the zip. It exited 0 and was wrong twice -
#     rooted at `Ghoztty-portable-x64\Ghoztty\...` instead of `Ghoztty\...`, and
#     carrying both `.pdb` files (20.3 MB -> 41.9 MB over a network share).
#   * 2026-08-10, found while writing the script under test: both portable
#     locations held a DEBUG `ghoztty.exe` (+edc526574, PE subsystem 3) beside a
#     RELEASE `ghoztty.com` (+213a21f0d), an hour after the morning refresh had
#     logged `extra install '...': ghoztty.exe, ghoztty.com, ...`. The copy
#     reported success and the bytes on disk were from another build.
#
# So the arms below are about the CHECKS, not the copy:
#
#   A  pure: the manifest, the zip inclusion rule, the entry-set diff, the
#      backup-generation retention rule. No filesystem.
#   B  the PE subsystem read against real binaries - the one signal that tells a
#      release ghoztty.exe from a Debug one without trusting a version string.
#   C  end-to-end into a sandbox seeded with a DEBUG build, which is the
#      2026-08-10 state: it must be replaced and verified.
#   D  teeth. A staging prefix that is a Debug build is refused; a delivery whose
#      binaries do not answer the expected commit FAILS; a zip whose entry set
#      moved is NOT published.
#   E  the second run is a no-op apart from new backups, and still verifies.
#   G  the AUDIT (T727): the same checks run against the locations as they
#      stand, writing nothing - the question nobody could ask between
#      deliveries - plus the unattended reader that runs it and the health
#      field that reports its verdict.
#
# Hermetic: every directory it writes is under the sandbox root, the real
# install locations are never named, and no build is ever run. It reads two real
# binaries (the release staging prefix and the debug zig-out) but only ever
# copies them into the sandbox.
