# T1151 acceptance: a build that lives in a source checkout registers nothing.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE HARNESS. url-scheme.ps1 proves ONE gate;
# agent-autostart.ps1 proves a second. Neither can say whether a THIRD
# registration was added last week with no gate at all, and that is the shape
# both real incidents took: T1124 (the staging release pointed the user's
# ghoztty:// links at a scratch directory for days) and T1146 (the same for the
# Run entry Windows obeys at sign-in, which survives a reboot). So this script
# asserts the SET rather than a site: every registration-shaped write in the
# tree is named by docs\design\windows-registration-sites.md, and every row that
# claims a location gate still has one.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A REGISTRATION. A write that outlives the process AND that the
# OS, the shell, or another program reads on the user's behalf: an HKCU value, a
# file under %USERPROFILE% outside our own state dir, a scheduled task, an MSI
# product change. The state directory (%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\*) is deliberately
# NOT in scope - it is lineage-suffixed, nothing outside Ghoztty reads it, and
# T350's build-mode rule already covers it. The inventory doc says all of this.
#
# Sections:
#
#   A  INVENTORY COMPLETENESS. Scan src/ for the registration primitives
#      (RegSetValueExW / RegCreateKeyExW, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, schtasks, the
#      Startup folder, the home-relative hook install dir). Every file that
#      holds one must appear in the inventory doc - in the gated table or in
#      the deliberately-ungated table with its reason. An unlisted file FAILS
#      and names itself, which is the whole point: the next registration cannot
#      arrive quietly.
#   B  GATE PRESENCE. Every file the doc lists as location-gated actually
#      references the gate (inSourceCheckout), and every file listed as
#      canonical-install-gated actually compares against Programs\Ghoztty. A row
#      whose file lost its gate goes red.
#   C  ONE GATE, ONE ANSWER. The gate helper lives in exactly one place
#      (src\os\source_checkout.zig) and the win32 spelling is a re-export, so
#      the app's answer and the agent's answer cannot drift apart. This is the
#      T1151 move that let adopt.zig - which uninstalls the user's standalone
#      MSI product - ask the same question the app asks.
#   D  BEHAVIOR, against the user's real registrations. Snapshot
#      HKCU\Software\Classes\ghoztty*, the Run values and HKCU\Environment\Path;
#      launch this repo's build with every self-heal seam set to `gate` (the
#      release location gate applied to a debug build); assert the snapshot is
#      byte-identical afterwards. The CONTROL is the same launch without the
#      gate seam: the debug lineage class MUST appear, which proves the
#      observation can see a registration at all - a green section D with a
#      blind probe would be worthless. The control only ever writes the
#      `ghoztty-debug` lineage, never the release names the user's shell obeys.
#
# ORACLE. Registry reads, not log lines: what this measures is the user's
# machine state, so it reads the machine rather than the app's opinion of it.
#
# Sections A-C are a static scan (safe anywhere, including the off-desktop
# harness). Section D launches the repo build and is skipped with -NoLaunch or
# when no build is present.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\registration-sites.ps1
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\registration-sites.ps1 -NegativeControl
#
# isolation: debug build only (BuildMode preflight); the launch uses
# --session-persistence=false and its own window, and every registration seam is
# gated, so nothing of the user's is written.
