# T230 acceptance: an agent restart must NEVER re-execute a pane's recorded
# command.
#
# The defect: `session-relaunch` defaulted to `auto`, so when the local agent
# restarted (a reboot, or the T147 mandatory agent upgrade) every restored pane
# fired a RELAUNCH of the command it had been opened with. The user rejected
# that outright, verbatim (2026-07-31): "We should not ever re-execute the
# commands which were previously ran, but, the console message which says the
# session was closed could list the previous command executed so the user can
# choose to copy/paste it."
#
# The new default is `restore`: no respawn, a fresh shell in the recorded working
# directory, and a notice above it naming the command that was running.
#
# (T823 renamed the three values to the ones the Mac seat ships - `notify` ->
# `restore`, `auto` -> `rerun` - so the setting can be spelled the same way on
# both platforms. This file keeps its name so the evidence pointers in the task
# files that cite it still resolve; the behavior it measures is unchanged.)
#
# Measured by OUTCOME - whether the recorded process is RUNNING, what the pane
# actually shows, and whether the pane takes input - not by log scraping:
#
#   A: the contract. Two panes opened with two DISTINGUISHABLE long-lived
#      commands, agent killed, app relaunched. Neither command is running
#      afterwards (the process table is the oracle), each pane shows the notice
#      naming ITS OWN command and not the other's, and each pane accepts input
#      on a live shell. Since T423 it also proves the notice is in the pane's
#      own SCROLLBACK, above the shell's output - not only in the banner
#      overlay, which is all that used to survive. Since T922/D78 it also proves
#      the pane comes back showing WHAT THE DEAD SESSION LEFT ON SCREEN, above
#      that notice, instead of an empty prompt.
#   B: negative control / opt-in - `--session-relaunch=rerun` still respawns the
#      recorded command. Without this, A would also pass against a build that
#      simply broke restore.
#   C: a pane whose recorded cwd was DELETED while the agent was down still
#      comes up on a working prompt (a missing directory must not kill a pane).
#   D: the recorded cwd TRACKS the shell (T425) - a pane the user `cd`'d out of
#      restores where they actually were, not where the shell was spawned.
#      Scored on the agent's own sessions.json AND on what the restored shell
#      prints for `cd`.
#   M: the INVERSE (T974). Every arm above kills the session manager AND its PTY
#      holders, because that is the reboot shape. Kill only the MANAGER and the
#      outcome must be the opposite of arm A's: since T909 the holders outlive
#      it, so the command the user was running is still the SAME process, no
#      pane claims an interruption in either carrier, and the panes stay on
#      their own sessions and keep taking input. Without this arm an agent
#      upgrade that started killing panes would leave the file green.
#
# The commands are `ping -n <unique> 127.0.0.1`: long-lived, harmless, and each
# carries a unique count that makes it findable in Win32_Process.CommandLine -
# so "did the recorded command run again?" is a process-table question with a
# yes/no answer, not an inference from pane text.

# ============================================================================
# Arm A's inverse, against the same build, in the same script.
#
# Arm A is the REBOOT shape: the manager and every holder die, so the next
# launch finds tombstones and each pane comes back with the interrupted notice
# over a fresh shell. Since T909 the AGENT-RESTART shape is a different thing -
# the ConPTY, the shell and whatever the user was running live in a `--pty-host`
# holder that outlives its manager on purpose, so a manager that crashes or is
# upgraded comes back, ADOPTS its holders, and nothing was ever interrupted.
# T922 pointed the arms above squarely at the reboot shape by killing the
# holders too (correctly - that IS a reboot), and in doing so left the
# agent-restart shape measured by nothing: a regression that started killing
# panes on every agent upgrade would take this whole file green with it.
#
# So: kill ONLY the manager, leave the app and the holders alone, and assert the
# opposite outcome on the same oracles arm A uses.
#   - the recorded command is still running, as THE SAME PROCESS (a re-execute
#     would show the same marker under a brand new pid)
#   - no pane claims an interruption, in the banner OR in its own scrollback
#   - the plain pane still holds what it printed before the kill, is on the same
#     session id, and still takes input
#
# The absence claims are only worth something with positive controls beside
# them, and they are all in this file: arm A proves this build DOES raise the
# notice when a session really died, and M's own marker and liveness assertions
# prove the panes being read are real panes rather than empty dumps.
#
# Which assertions actually carry the claim, measured under `-BreakHolders`
# (holders killed with the manager - the regression shape): M11, M13, M15, M16
# and M18 go red. M17 and M19 stay GREEN there and are controls, not claims -
# a rebuilt pane still takes input, and since T922/D78 it is even repainted with
# the dead session's last screen, so "the marker is still there" cannot by
# itself tell a survivor from a replacement. Only the session id and the shell's
