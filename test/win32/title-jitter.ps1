# T60 acceptance: an animated leading glyph must not move the title, the tab,
# or anything laid out from either.
#
# THE BUG. An agent that animates its title - Claude Code, which is what runs
# in every pane on this box - cycles one leading glyph on a timer and leaves
# the rest of the string alone ("* Reviewing the parity backlog", where the *
# is one frame of `. + * ~ x`). Those glyphs are not one width. Measured in
# Segoe UI at the user's 125% with GetTextExtentPoint32W: U+00B7 is 4 px and
# U+2733 is 27 px, a 23 px swing several times a second. Everything after the
# glyph was laid out from its advance, so every frame moved two things - the
# title text slid left/right inside its box, and because a tab asks for the
# width its own title needs (T235), the chiclet and the "+" slid with it.
#
# THE FIX (src/apprt/win32/title_spinner.zig). A title that leads with a
# symbol glyph and a space gets that glyph drawn CENTERED IN A FIXED CELL, and
# the rest of the title starts at the cell's right edge - measured the same way
# it is painted, so `preferredWidth` stops tracking the glyph too.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT MEASURES, and why each control is here:
#
#   Section 1 - the WINDOW TITLE in the caption band (a one-tab window is
#     `.standalone`, so the caption paints a title). The title is driven with
#     `+rename --title=`, which is exact and needs no shell interaction at all.
#     The oracle is an INK PROFILE: one character per client column, '1' if any
#     pixel in the band differs from the band background. Two regions are
#     profiled per frame - the cell, and everything right of it.
#
#       * 1a is the control that makes 1b mean anything: the CELL's profile
#         must DIFFER across frames. If it did not, the frames would be
#         rendering identically (a title that never arrived, a window that
#         never repainted) and "the text does not move" would be true of
#         nothing. This is the T240 lesson - a probe that cannot see the
#         trigger cannot score the fix.
#       * 1b is the fix: the profile RIGHT of the cell must be byte-identical
#         across all eight frames.
#       * 1c is the sensitivity control: an ASCII leading character is NOT a
#         spinner (it has a fixed advance, so it never jittered), so it gets no
#         cell and its text starts somewhere else. Its profile must therefore
#         DIFFER from the spinner frames'. A probe that returned the same
#         string for a genuinely shifted title would pass 1b for free.
#
#   Section 2 - the TAB CHICLET. A second tab makes the strip appear; the tab's
#     title comes from the pane's own shell (`chcp 65001` then cmd's `title`
#     builtin, which is SetConsoleTitleW and is forwarded by ConPTY). Tab
#     extents are read off the strip's pixels by lib\ChromeGeometry.ps1.
#
#       * 2a is the fix: the chiclet's left AND right edges must be identical
#         across all eight frames.
#       * 2b is the control: a LONGER title must still widen the tab. Freezing
#         a tab's width outright would pass 2a and break T235.
#       * The retitle control in between is not decoration. The first version
#         of this script drove the title through a mechanism that silently did
#         nothing, so 2a passed on a tab whose title never changed - a green
#         assertion measuring nothing at all. The titles are now read back
#         from `+list` and asserted to differ.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS, both required and both real:
#   * -NegativeControl inverts 1b and 2a (asserts they DO move) and MUST fail.
#   * Source-level: flip T60_NEUTERED in src/apprt/win32/title_spinner.zig to
#     `true`, rebuild `-Dapp-runtime=win32`, re-run. 1b and 2a must fail;
#     1a, 1c and 2b must NOT. That is the run that proves this script scores
#     the fix rather than the harness. (Recorded in docs/design/
#     windows-parity-tasks/T60.md.)
