# Machine-chooser RESTORE ALL against a REMOTE machine (tracker T336).
#
# T335 rebuilds THIS machine's whole window/tab/split topology from the blobs its
# own agent holds. This is the same rebuild pointed at another machine over the
# relay - the half that closes T146 - and it is a separate task because of one
# structural difference with no Mac analog: Mac hands every rebuilt window ONE
# connection (SessionLayoutRestore.swift:659-675), while win32 windows each OWN
# their transport (`Window.deinit` tears it down). Sharing one dial here would
# mean the first window the user closes takes the others' agent with it, so the
# rule is one dial per window - and this script is where that is visible rather
# than asserted in a comment.
#
# THE FIXTURE, and why it is not T319's. A cross-machine Restore All needs a
# machine whose agent holds LAYOUT BLOBS, and the only thing that pushes a blob
# is an APP pushing to ITS OWN local agent (T334). A bare
# `ghoztty-agent --listen` - T319's "other machine" - has no app, so it holds no
# layouts, and a correct implementation against it returns zero. The only
# machine on this box that an app has lived on is this one, and its agent listens
# on a NAMED PIPE. So:
#
#   app A (persistence on)  ->  local agent  ->  layouts.json          [fixture]
#   kill app A, delete port.json                                       [orphan]
#   lib\PipeBridge.ps1      ->  that pipe, exposed on a TCP port
#   lib\FakeRelay.ps1       ->  ws://.../connect bridged to that port
#   app B (persistence OFF) ->  sees it ONLY as relay device dev-remote
#
# Deleting `port.json` is what makes the discrimination real: app B and the CLI
# both find the local agent through that file, so with it gone the Local row can
# only resolve to `failed` - and every session app B can see, it saw through the
# relay. The PipeBridge does not need the file (it knows the pipe name), so the
# agent itself is untouched and keeps its children alive.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   A  the fixture: the agent holds a 3-pane window's layout blob (file evidence)
#   B  with port.json gone the Local row fails, and offers no Restore All - so
#      nothing that follows can be the local path in disguise
#   C  the device row loads the machine's sessions and Restore All is SHOWN.
#      This is the T336 regression: the pre-T336 rule was `row == .local`, so
#      this assertion fails against the old build with the button HIDDEN
#   D  an EXPIRED bearer (401 injected after the roster loaded) leaves the
#      chooser open with a sign-in message and builds NO window - the failure
#      mode that must not half-build a topology
#   E  the rebuild: one window, its recorded 3-pane split shape, over the relay
#   F  per-window transport ownership: the restore spends >= 2 dials (the pull's
#      own, plus one per window), counted in the relay's request log
#   F2 those per-window dials are opened TOGETHER (T616). The relay answers every
#      connect 1.5 s late, so a serial restore can only open window k's dial once
#      window k-1's was answered - its CONNECT lines land a whole delay apart.
#      The relay's own log is the witness, so this is not a wall-clock guess
#   F3 and the wait the user actually sits through therefore does not grow with
#      the window count: the whole restore costs about two round trips, not 1 + N
#   I  the app keeps PUMPING while those dials are outstanding (T339). The relay
#      is told to answer every connect 1.5 s late, so the restore is in flight
#      for seconds, and the chooser is asked for a WM_NULL every 150 ms
#      throughout. Before T339 all N+1 upgrades ran on the GUI thread and every
#      one of those probes would time out
#   G  independent oracle - the agent, asked directly over its pipe, reports all
#      three original sessions ATTACHED
#   J  which re-attach a blob-sourced pane takes: offset=0, no WP-D3 delta the
#      blob cannot carry, and the pane's own output readable afterwards
#   J2 and what it COSTS (T621): the fresh attach takes a scrollback-bearing
#      repaint reflowed to this pane's size, not the agent's whole raw ring -
#      asserted across the relay, so the capability survives the hop
#   K  a rebuilt remote pane is LIVE, not a replayed picture
#   H  pressing it again rebuilds nothing: the machine-scoped double-attach
#      guard holds across the relay too
#
# The keyboard is the trigger under test, not a shortcut around it: Tab walks to
# the button and the script asserts FOCUS LANDED ON IT before pressing Return
# (the T240 lesson - "nothing happened" is equally consistent with the keys never
# arriving).
#
# T248: every repo ghoztty/ghoztty-agent is killed at setup and the agent state
# is dropped, so the fixture is built fresh rather than measuring the last run.
# T267: the script sets its own window size instead of inheriting whatever the
# last GUI script left in window_placement-debug.
