# The delivery must never ship a binary that is not the delivery (tracker T208).
#
# On 2026-07-30 a boundary delivery of T202 ran `launch-upgrade.ps1`, which
# reported `LAUNCH OK`; the upgrade log reported `exe swapped` and `UPGRADE OK`;
# the turn reported the delivery as done. `ghoztty +version` afterwards still
# said `+9968a62d9` - the PREVIOUS delivery's binary. `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1`
# has no build step by design (it copies whatever sits in `zig-out-release`) and
# that precondition was written down nowhere the caller reads.
#
# So there is now a number both ends can compare - the short commit baked into
# the exe by `src/build/GitVersion.zig` - and three gates on it:
#
#   A  pure: reading the commit out of a `+version` payload, and comparing two
#      abbreviations. Carries the 2026-07-30 incident as a permanent oracle.
#   B  the probe against a real binary, including the two ways it can fail.
#   C  launch-upgrade.ps1 refuses to launch a stale staging prefix - and, the
#      half that matters, does not start the upgrade at all when it refuses.
#   D  upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1 skips the KILL and the SWAP on stale bits
#      (its own belt-and-braces, and the direct-invocation path), and verifies
#      the installed exe AFTER the swap so `UPGRADE OK` means the right bits are
#      installed rather than "a file copy returned success".
#   E  go.md documents the whole procedure, since the omission there is what
#      made the defect reachable by a turn following instructions exactly.
#   G  T531: a -NoResume run that killed a running app still relaunches it
#      (the typing is skipped, the terminal comes back), stated in the log as
#      `relaunched app pid N`.
#
# Hermetic: every install/staging directory is under
# %TEMP%\ghoztty-staleness-<pid>, TEMP is redirected for every child so the
# box's real upgrade log is untouched, no build is ever run, -NoExtraInstalls
# keeps section D away from the real portable/share copies, and -NoDeliver keeps
# section C's launcher from running the T198 delivery step against them. The one shared

# CreateProcess fails with ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT and the Windows loader answers
# with a SYSTEM-MODAL `Unsupported 16-Bit Application` box - on whatever desktop
# the caller is on, waiting for a human to click OK. The delivery's own read-back
# checks (T208, T281) walk exactly that path, and T525's morning refresh walks it
# unattended at 5am on the user's own desktop.
#
# So the gate is a header read, and these arms pin all three halves of it: the
# verdict, the reason, and - the one that would catch a regression to launching -
# that answering takes no time at all.

# answering +list, and must say so as `relaunched app pid N`.

# local-agent-debug state dir plus GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN keeps the relaunched
# app off the box's real debug agent (the agent pipe has no suffix override).
# The "running release app" the kill matches is a renamed powershell sleeping
# in the sandbox install dir, so no real terminal is ever killed.
