# Chooser control-locator acceptance (T294) - the harness module every other
# chooser script now asks "which control is this".
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\chooser-controls.ps1
#
# `lib\ChooserControls.ps1` replaced seven private copies of "find the
# management button" / "find the account control" / "find Restore All", each of
# which identified a control by its LABEL, by its POSITION in a row, or by
# EXCLUDING the labels it is not. T177 added one button to the detail pane's
# action row and two of those copies silently started naming the new button;
# T335 added another and grew two more copies. The module asks the app for the
# control's own ID instead (`GetDlgCtrlID` - the `hMenu` MachineChooser.zig
# passed to CreateWindowEx, which is what WM_COMMAND is routed on).
#
# That trades one failure mode for another, and this script measures both:
#
#   A. THE COUPLING. The ids are restated in the harness, so they can drift
#      from the app's. Section A parses `src/apprt/win32/MachineChooser.zig`
#      (and `win32.zig` for IDOK/IDCANCEL) and fails if the two tables ever
#      disagree - in either direction, including an id the app grew that the
#      harness does not know about. No GUI: this half runs anywhere.
#
#   B. THE LOOKUPS, against the real dialog. Every named control resolves, to
#      distinct windows, of the right class, and - the property the label and
#      geometry copies could not keep - a HIDDEN control is still FOUND, with
#      `Visible` reporting the state rather than the lookup answering "absent".
#      The claims those private copies made as premises (the primary is
#      labeled "New Window"; the menu button is square; the account row holds
#      exactly two controls of which one is visible) are assertions here, which
#      is the point: a lookup keyed on a label cannot also test the label.
#
#      B also scores the module's one non-lookup, `Focus-ChooserControl` (T342):
#      the Tab walk three restore-all scripts used to keep a private copy of.
#      It is a POSITIVE CONTROL wherever it is used, so both directions are
#      scored - it lands on a reachable control, AND a walk at an unreachable
#      one comes back false with a trail naming the step that lost focus. A
#      walk that fails intermittently and says nothing is what T342 was filed
#      for.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts B's hidden-control assertion to expect the management
# button to be MISSING while it is hidden, which MUST fail; it is how a run proves the lookup
# really does see through visibility rather than getting lucky.
#
# T218-era rules: runs on a BACKGROUND test desktop, so it never takes the
# user's foreground (asserted at the end, not assumed), and only ever touches
# ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out.
