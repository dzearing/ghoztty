# T476 - the zig self-hosted-backend crash reduction stays true.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. T476 reduced "ghostty-test cannot be compiled with
# `-Dtest-llvm=false`" down to fifteen lines that touch no ghoztty source at
# all: `test\zig-repro\t476-selfhosted-backend`. A reduction is only worth
# keeping if it is still the same question the original asked, and if somebody
# finds out when the answer changes. Both of those rot silently:
#
#   * the reduction pins ghoztty's `src\build\uucode_config.zig`, and the crash
#     needs THAT config - a trimmed one compiles clean. If the real config
#     moves and the copy does not, the reduction quietly stops describing the
#     build it came from.
#   * the whole point of `-Dtest-llvm` is that it comes OUT when the compiler
#     is fixed, and nothing was ever going to notice a zig upgrade that fixed
#     it. Section C is that noticing: it fails when the repro compiles clean,
#     because a clean compile is the signal to drop the knob and delete the
#     directory.
#
# Section C needs a scratch copy on the cache's drive (zig 0.15.2 asserts when
# the project and ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR are on different drives), and it takes a
# minute or two the first time it generates uucode's tables. `-SkipCompile`
# runs A and B alone.
