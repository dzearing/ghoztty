# Cross-LINEAGE layout blobs (tracker T337) - a macOS-shaped blob rebuilds here.
#
# A layout blob is opaque to the agent by design, so its schema is a contract
# between two VIEWERS - and the two lineages never shared one. macOS pushes a
# `SessionLayoutManifest.Entry`: camelCase keys, ONE blob per TAB (siblings share
# a `tabGroupID` and order by `tabIndex`), and a NESTED `tree` whose Swift enum
# cases wrap their payload in `_0`. win32 pushes a `session_layout.Window`:
# snake_case, one blob per WINDOW, a FLAT `nodes` array with `left`/`right`
# indices. Before T337 a Windows viewer pointed at a Mac decoded none of it and
# reported "nothing to restore" - the feature looked present and was not.
#
# The unit tests in `layout_blobs.zig` / `mac_layout_blob.zig` own the decode
# surface. What they cannot show is that the REAL binary spends the translation:
# that `decodeLayouts` is on the launch-restore path, that a translated window
# survives `restoreWindow`, and that Mac's per-TAB records come back as ONE
# window with its tabs rather than N loose ones. That is this script.
#
#   A. Build a 2-window / 3-pane layout on a hermetic instance and let the agent
#      mirror it (2 layout records, 3 live sessions).
#   B. TRANSPLANT: stop the app AND the agent, then rewrite the agent's
#      `layouts.json` so both records hold MAC-shaped blobs over the same three
#      session ids - two entries sharing one `tabGroupID`, `tabIndex` 0 and 1.
#      Delete the local manifest, so restore has nothing but those blobs to read.
#   C. RESTORE: relaunch and assert ONE window with TWO tabs and THREE panes -
#      the topology the Mac blobs describe, not the 2-window one the fixture had
#      - with the split in tab ONE, and an ATTACH issued for each of the three
#      session ids the Mac blobs named.
#
# C is the assertion that was RED before T337: every blob was skipped as
# unreadable and the relaunch opened a blank window. `-NegativeControl` inverts
# it, so a run that scores this build as still-broken is available on demand.
# C5 is the T623 half: the blobs carry `primaryScreenHeight`, so the restored
# window must land the same way UP it was left (Cocoa's bottom-up y flipped
# about the source primary's top edge), not vertically mirrored.
#
# Why the agent is stopped in B: it holds its blob store in MEMORY and answers
# GET_LAYOUTS from there, so editing `layouts.json` under a live agent would
# change nothing and the script would pass on the old bytes.
#
# The cost of stopping it is that the three sessions come back as relaunchable
# TOMBSTONES rather than the same PIDs. That is still a supported attach path
# (`restoreWindowHasAttachableLeaf`: "alive or relaunchable tombstone") and the
# ATTACHes are what this script reads. What it deliberately does NOT assert is
# the roster afterwards: `session-relaunch = restore` (the default) brings the
# pane up on a FRESH shell in the recorded cwd and RETIRES the tombstone, so the
# three ids on the roster at the end are new by design - a fact about the
# relaunch policy, not about blob translation. `session-crash-recover.ps1` is
# the oracle for same-PID re-attach, which needs a surviving agent.
#
# Non-interactive and headless-safe: no foreground grabs and no synthetic input,
# so it needs no background-desktop harness. Fully hermetic: a per-run
# $env:LOCALAPPDATA, a per-run GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN, a private IPC pipe
# suffix, and it ONLY ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched from
# the repo zig-out - never the user's installed release.
