# T367 acceptance: the remote connection pill in the caption band.
#
# A remote window's link can die with nothing on screen changing - until T367
# the only way to find out was to type into a pane and watch nothing happen.
# The pill is the affordance that says so, and the button that fixes it.
#
# What this asserts, and how:
#
#   1. CONNECTED shows a green dot. A real remote window is opened against a
#      loopback ghoztty-agent, the window is PrintWindow'd, and the pixel where
#      caption_layout + remote_pill say the dot lands is measured to be
#      distinctly green. Painted pixels from a live window - not a synthesized
#      answer.
#   2. A connected pill NAMES the machine and IS a button (T610). The label is
#      read from the app's own oracle line (a name in the caption face is a
#      handful of grey pixels no probe can read back), the capsule is measured
#      to be wider than the wordless dot-only pill it used to be, and
#      WM_NCHITTEST at the pill answers HTOBJECT. Mac's MachinePillCapsule is
#      clickable in exactly this state; before T610 this section asserted the
#      opposite, which was T367 stopping deliberately short.
#   2b. Clicking a CONNECTED pill opens the Activity Monitor on this window's
#      existing connection - a GhozttyActivityMonitor window appears, and the
#      app logs that it reused a connection rather than dialing its own.
#   3. DROPPED turns the pill red and MAKES it a button. The agent is killed;
#      the script polls until the capsule paints red and WM_NCHITTEST answers
#      HTOBJECT at the same point.
#   4. The button ACTS, and the window COMES BACK. The WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN/UP pair
#      Windows posts after its own hit test is sent on HTOBJECT; the app dials
#      IMMEDIATELY - a manual attempt, distinguishable in the log from an
#      automatic one because an automatic attempt waits out a backoff and a
#      manual one does not - and the pill goes GREEN again, which is the answer
#      the button exists to give.
#   5. A LOCAL window has no pill at all. Same strip of band, plain chrome.
#      A local window keeps its whole drag band, which is the other half of
#      section 2's trade: only a window that HAS a machine gives up that width.
#
# LIMITS, stated rather than glossed:
#   * Section 4 posts the messages the OS would post. It proves the handler is
#     right; it does not prove Windows routes a real pointer to it (T240).
#     Section 3's hit-test assertion is what proves the OS would ask.
#   * Section 4's recovery arm was suspended between T367 and T611, when a
#     manual reconnect whose remote session was gone - a restarted agent, a
#     rebooted box - still took the driver's `.terminal` arm and the pill
#     correctly stayed red. T611 made the click open a fresh shell per pane, so
#     the arm is back to the assertion this file was written with first. What
#     the recovered pane CONTAINS (the same split layout, live shells) is
#     `remote-reconnect-fresh.ps1`; here it is only the pill.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: -NegativeControl inverts section 1 (asserts the connected
# pill is ABSENT) and MUST fail.
#
# Runs on the background test desktop; only ever touches ghoztty processes
# started by this script.
