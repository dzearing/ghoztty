# Machine-chooser SESSION RESUME against a REMOTE machine (tracker T331).
#
# T320 shipped both halves of resume and only the LOCAL one is measured on box:
# `chooser-resume.ps1` builds its fixture out of the local agent's own orphaned
# sessions, because that is the machine a script can create sessions on. The
# remote half - `MachineChooser.resumeRow`'s `.remote` branch,
# `App.resumeRelaySession`, and `openDialedWindow`'s ATTACH shape - was code
# that compiles, is reachable from the UI, and had never once run here.
#
# THE FIXTURE, and why it is `chooser-restore-all-remote.ps1`'s rather than
# T319's. A remote resume needs a machine holding LIVE, UNATTACHED sessions
# whose content this script can recognise afterwards. A bare
# `ghoztty-agent --listen` (T319's "other machine") can hold sessions, but the
# only way to put a marker in one is to open a window on it - and closing that
# window ENDS the session, while leaving it open makes the row `open_locally`,
# which the chooser answers by FOCUSING the pane instead of attaching (T330).
# So the machine is this box's own agent, taken away and handed back only over
# the relay:
#
#   app A (persistence on)  ->  local agent  ->  three live sessions   [fixture]
#   kill app A                                                          [orphan]
#   delete port.json           the local agent is undiscoverable locally
#   lib\PipeBridge.ps1      ->  that pipe, exposed on a TCP port
#   lib\FakeRelay.ps1       ->  ws://.../connect bridged to that port
#   app B (persistence OFF) ->  sees it ONLY as relay device dev-remote
#
# Deleting `port.json` is what makes every reading discriminate: app B and the
# CLI both find the local agent through that file, so with it gone the Local row
# can only resolve to `failed` and everything app B knows about that machine, it
# learned through the relay.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   A  setup: the machine's sessions are alive and UNATTACHED once app A is
#      gone, and the Local row of a fresh app has nothing to list
#   B  the device row loads that machine's roster over the relay, and Right
#      steps the keyboard cursor into it
#   C  Return on the cursored row resumes THAT session: the app names the id and
#      the device, the dial crosses the relay (counted on the far side), the
#      pane really ATTACHes, and the chooser dismisses onto the new window
#   D  the ATTACH shape (the T331 risk): a resumed window does NOT take the
#      machine's per-host default cwd, because an attach does not spawn and a
#      cwd sent with it would describe a spawn that is not happening. The
#      POSITIVE CONTROL is a NEW remote window through the same relay, which
#      MUST land in that stored directory - otherwise "the default did not
#      apply" is equally consistent with a store nothing reads
#   E  the resumed pane is LIVE, not painted (T652): typing crosses the relay to
#      the machine's own child and its answer comes back
#   F  the independent oracle - the agent, asked directly over its pipe once
#      port.json is back, reports that session ATTACHED where it was not before
#   G  a tripped relay leaves the chooser OPEN with its hint set and builds NO
#      window - never a half-open one - and then the SAME keys on the SAME row
#      resume it once the relay answers again (the mandatory positive control:
#      "nothing happened" is otherwise equally consistent with the keys never
#      arriving, the T240 lesson)
