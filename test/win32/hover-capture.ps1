# T282 acceptance: the debug-only `capture-hover` IPC action - painting and
# capturing a HOVERED frame off the background test desktop.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROVED, and why it needs proving. A posted WM_MOUSEMOVE cannot
# survive to the paint it dirties on a desktop with no real cursor: the OS
# posts WM_MOUSELEAVE within a frame (TrackMouseEvent watches the real one) and
# WM_PAINT is the lowest-priority message in the queue, so the leave is drained
# FIRST and the painted frame is the un-hovered one. T209 measured 300 posted
# moves in bursts of 25, interleaved with captures, and never once caught a lit
# fill. So every hover FILL in the win32 chrome was a SKIP (tab-strip's 4c,
# pane-banner's 6f3) or a per-site workaround through a state that survives a
# leave (split-divider's DRAG, caption-bar's caption_pressed).
#
# The action moves the whole probe into the app's GUI thread, where hit test,
# move, repaint and capture all happen on ONE stack with no return to the
# message loop - and a posted message is only ever drained by the message loop.
# See src/apprt/win32/ipc_hover.zig for the ordering argument.
#
# THE LOAD-BEARING ORACLE IS SECTION 3, and it is deliberately not "a hovered
# capture is brighter somewhere". TWO controls are probed from TWO captures:
# hovering the "+" must light the "+"'s fill and leave the tab's close "x"
# dark, and hovering the "x" must light the "x"'s and leave the "+"'s dark.
# Nothing that captured an un-hovered frame, a latched hover, or a flat fill
# can produce both of those right answers.
#
# Section 3b is the T845 oracle: the same capture taken twelve times over must
# be lit EVERY time and read the SAME value every time. One sample cannot tell a
# reliable seam from a nine-in-ten one, and nine-in-ten is what this was from
# T282 until T845 - the capture asked DWM for a copy of the composited surface,
# which is asynchronous, so about one in ten was a frame from before the hover.
#
# Section 4 asserts the other half of the design: the hover does NOT latch. The
# leave arrives on the next pump exactly as it does today, so a plain capture
# right after a hover capture reads the control at REST - which is what makes
# this a capture rather than a "suppress the leave" flag with a stuck-lit
# failure mode.
#
# -NegativeControl expects the "+" to be lit in the capture taken over the "x",
# which MUST fail: that is exactly the answer a latched or wrongly-attributed
# hover would give, so a green negative control means section 3 discriminates
# nothing.
