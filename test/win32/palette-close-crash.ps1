# T613: closing a window that has EVER opened one of the surface popups must
# not take the process down.
#
# THE DEFECT. `App.surfaceWndProc` serves three windows - the terminal child
# HWND, the search-bar popup and the command-palette popup - and its WM_DESTROY
# handler cleared `Surface.hwnd` for all three. `Surface.deinit` destroys the
# two popups a few lines BEFORE it clears the terminal window's GWLP_USERDATA,
# so the popup's WM_DESTROY nulled `hwnd`, the trailing `if (self.hwnd)` did
# nothing, and the terminal window went into `DestroyWindow` still holding a
# `*Surface` freed moments later. Win32 dispatches that window's WM_DESTROY
# through OPENGL32's `wglWndProc` subclass into the same procedure, which read
# the freed pointer: a hard segfault taking every window and every terminal in
# the process with it.
#
# WHY IT LOOKED LIKE AN ACTIVITY-MONITOR BUG. It was found closing a remote
# window with the Activity Monitor open (`activity-monitor-remote.ps1` G4), and
# "with no panel open" did not crash - because reaching the panel means opening
# the command PALETTE. The panel was the passenger. Nothing here is remote,
# nothing here needs an agent, and one arm never touches the palette at all.
#
# WHAT EACH ARM ADDS:
#   A. the palette, then `+close` - the plain CLI path.
#   B. the palette, then the title-bar X (real WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_CLOSE), because
#      that is the path a user actually takes and it is a different caller.
#   C. the SEARCH bar instead of the palette - the other popup with the same
#      wndproc and the same field, so the fix is not palette-shaped.
#
# The oracle is the process, not the screen: a crash is not a failed assertion
# anywhere, it is the absence of a pid. Each arm therefore also asserts the
# OTHER window is still there, which is what "the app survived" has to mean.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop and asserts at the end that it
# never took the user's foreground.
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
