# T150 acceptance: a runtime background change is accessibility-safe.
#
# The T67 script (window-color.ps1) proves the BACKGROUND reaches the glass.
# This one proves the colors DERIVED from it do -- which is a different
# claim and needs a different oracle, because none of it is visible in
# `+list --json`: the derived foreground, the regenerated 256-color palette,
# and the renderer's draw-time contrast floor all only exist as pixels.
#
# Oracle: `lib/paint-blocks.ps1` fills the pane with three bands, one per
# content class, and the probe reads back the color the renderer actually
# chose. Measured against the known background, every band must clear its
# floor from docs/design/win32-design-system.md 2.3.
#
#   band 1  default foreground     -> >= 4.5:1  (text floor)
#   band 2  256-color index 250    -> >= 3.0:1  (only a palette 16-255
#                                    regeneration can move it; stock
#                                    #bcbcbc on a light bg is ~1.2:1)
#   band 3  truecolor 230,230,230  -> >= 2.7:1  (no palette reaches it;
#                                    only the renderer minimum-contrast
#                                    pass can, at a nominal 3.0)
#
# Bands 1-2 are FULL BLOCK cells, which paint the whole cell. Band 3 is
# TEXT on purpose: `renderer/cell.zig:noMinContrast` exempts blocks and
# every other graphics element from the contrast pass, so a block band
# there would read back its raw color and call a working renderer broken.
#
# Plus the mid-grey regression: on #777777 the foreground must be BLACK
# (4.76:1). Rec.601 lightness calls that background "dark" and picks white,
# which measures 4.42:1 -- under the floor, and the exact hole T150 closes.
#
# MIGRATED TO THE BACKGROUND TEST DESKTOP (T275). This script used to be one of
# the two declared interactive-by-design exceptions: every number it reports is
# a color the RENDERER chose - derived foreground, regenerated palette,
# draw-time contrast floor - and none of that exists anywhere but in GL pixels,
# which off the input desktop had neither a composite to GetPixel nor a
# PrintWindow that returns anything but a flat fill. It now reads those pixels
# through route 0 (`lib\PaneCapture.ps1` -> the debug-only `capture-pane` IPC
# action), where the pane's own renderer hands back its offscreen target. The
# oracle - WCAG ratios against the known background, same floors, same patch
# scan for antialiased text - did not change; only where the pixels come from.
# What that buys is that an ACCESSIBILITY oracle can run in the loop instead of
# waiting for someone to be sitting at the box, which is exactly the rot T214
# named as the thing that would justify building this.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out.
