# T446 acceptance: a pending multi-key sequence and an active key table are
# VISIBLE on Windows.
#
# Ghoztty lets a binding be a sequence (press one combination, then a second
# key finishes it) and lets a binding drop you into a named "key table" where
# the keyboard temporarily means something else. Until this task the win32
# `.key_sequence` and `.key_table` apprt actions were acknowledged no-ops, so
# a pane waiting for the second half of a chord looked EXACTLY like a pane that
# had ignored the first half, and a table entered by accident silently
# reinterpreted every subsequent key with nothing on screen to say so.
#
# The mark is the key-state pill (class GhozttyKeyState, a WS_EX_LAYERED popup
# owned by the pane's surface HWND - `KeyStateIndicator.zig`).
#
# Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1), so it never steals
# the user's foreground - asserted here, not assumed.
#
# ORACLES. All structural, none pixel-based, for the reason readonly-badge.ps1
# documents: the pill paints through UpdateLayeredWindow and never services
# WM_PAINT, so PrintWindow has nothing to render.
#
#   - EXISTENCE + VISIBILITY of the pill, per pane, per state, and the
#     TRANSITIONS between them: it appears on the first key of a sequence, goes
#     away when the sequence completes AND when it is abandoned, appears on a
#     table activation and goes away on the matching deactivation.
#   - WHICH PANE it marks, by rect containment against each pane's own rect.
#   - THE ANCHOR, computed rather than eyeballed. The pill's window is the card
#     plus a UNIFORM shadow allowance, so the gap from the pane's bottom edge is
#     exactly `round(INSET*s) - (round(SHADOW_BLUR*s) + round(SHADOW_DY*s))` =
#     8s - (4s + 2s) in DIP, and the card is horizontally centered. Recomputed
#     from the window's real DPI, which is what makes it a regression test for
#     the geometry rather than a restatement of it.
#   - CONTENT, by WIDTH DELTAS rather than by reading pixels: a second nested
#     table adds a chevron and a name, and a pending key on top of a table adds
#     a divider and a key cap. Both must make the pill strictly wider. That is
#     what distinguishes "the pill appeared" from "the pill says what happened".
#
# Everything below the pixel line - the card's fill and opacity, the drop
# shade, the key-cap chips, the divider, the animated dots and both WCAG floors
# - is asserted in `key_state_pill.zig`'s unit tests, swept over the whole
# background ramp at 1.0/1.25/1.5/2.0, and the stack's push/pop/clear semantics
# in `key_state.zig`'s.
#
# A positive control (ctrl+k clear_screen, the T55/T74 pattern) runs first, so
# a broken injection aborts with a diagnosis instead of reading as a T446
# regression.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
