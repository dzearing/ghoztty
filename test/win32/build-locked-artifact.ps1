# T192 - `zig build` must install over an artifact a RUNNING process is holding
# open. Non-interactive; asserts and exits nonzero on any failure.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\build-locked-artifact.ps1
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST
#
# Windows holds an executable's image file open for the life of the process, and
# `ghoztty-agent.exe` outliving the app is the whole point of session
# persistence - so a plain dev-loop `zig build` on a box where an earlier test
# run left a repo-lineage agent alive died with
#
#   error: unable to update file from '.zig-cache\o\<hash>\ghoztty-agent.exe'
#          to 'zig-out\bin\ghoztty-agent.exe': AccessDenied
#
# after `ghoztty.exe` had ALREADY installed. That shape is the expensive part: a
# session that trusts the exit code concludes "my change did not build" over a
# binary that really did change, or writes off a real test result as a stale
# binary. `src/build/install_unlock_main.zig` moves the locked destination aside
# (`<name>.old-<n>`) so the install's atomic rename lands on an empty path.
#
# HOW THE ARMS FORCE THE COLLISION
#
# The install step (`std.fs.Dir.updateFile`) skips the copy when size and mtime
# already match, so a locked-but-current file is in nobody's way and the failure
# does not reproduce. `-Dagent-version=<stamp>` re-links the agent with a
# different baked string - a genuinely new artifact, in ~15s, with no source
# edit - and that same stamp is then the oracle for WHICH binary landed on disk:
# it is searched for verbatim in the installed bytes. The stamp is a build-time
# override of the agent's self-update identity only; nothing else reads it.
#
# `GHOZTTY_INSTALL_UNLOCK=0` turns the guard off, which is how arm 2 reproduces
# the original failure from this same tree. Without that arm the suite could not
# tell "the fix works" from "the trap no longer reproduces".
