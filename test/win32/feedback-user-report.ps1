# T1321 acceptance: a report drained from the viewer feedback queue is treated
# as a USER REPORT, on the bytes that actually ship.
#
# Why this exists. T1315 made `user-report: true` the thing that turns closing
# a task into a same-day release request, because a fix a person asked for is
# not delivered until they can install it - on 2026-09-03 the user downloaded
# the same broken installer twice and reported the same bug twice, with the fix
# sitting on the branch (T1294). The single biggest producer of genuine user
# reports is the viewer feedback button, and the skill that drains its queue
# (`process-feedback`) ended at "commit and move on": nothing anywhere recorded
# that a person was waiting, so every one of those fixes rode the ordinary
# daily cadence.
#
# THE RULE this checks, in the skill document the app installs:
#
#   complete path  records a release request
#                  (`scripts/daily-publish.ps1 -Request -Reason ...`)
#   blocked path   files what it did not fix with
#                  (`scripts/parity-tasks.ps1 new -UserReport`), and says what
#                  the flag buys (`user-report: true`)
#
# and that the two copies of that document - the Mac bundle resource and the
# `@embedFile`d Windows asset - are byte-identical, since the Windows app ships
# the second one and a drift there is a fix nobody is told is waiting.
#
# `upstream/` is deliberately NOT compared: it is the pristine mirror of
# tip-of-main's `macos/Resources/Ghoztty/` (GhosttyAssets.zig's header), so it
# is EXPECTED to lag this branch until the cutover. Asserting equality there
# would fail the moment this branch edits a shipped skill, which is exactly
# what it is for.
#
# Static scan, no app, no CLI - safe on the off-desktop harness.
