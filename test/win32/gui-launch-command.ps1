# GUI launch path: `ghoztty -e <args...>` and `ghoztty --command=...` (T104).
#
# The gap this covers: on Mac/Linux `ghostty -e cmd...` runs the command in the
# first window. On Windows the args were parsed into `initial-command` and then
# silently DROPPED - the pane came up on a plain default shell. `--command=` on
# the same launch path was dropped identically, and so was a `command` set in the
# user's config file.
#
# The cause was not the parser. Session persistence is ON by default on Windows,
# so every local pane's IO backend is the LOCAL AGENT, and the agent branch in
# `Surface.init` only forwarded a command when `wait-after-command` was set -
# which is a flag the APPRT sets when IT builds a command (the IPC / embedded
# `--command` paths), never something the app's own config sets. The launch
# path's command therefore matched nothing and was never sent in the OPEN.
# `Config._command-explicit` is the missing signal; see `Surface.init`.
#
# The oracle is the same in every section: read the pane back and look for the
# marker the launched command prints. A GUI that "opened a window" proves
# nothing - a window opens either way.
#
# Sections:
#   A  `-e <script> a b c` runs the command WITH ITS ARGUMENTS, with session
#      persistence at its default (on). Pre-fix: a bare shell prompt.
#   B  `--command=<script> a b` on the same launch path does the same.
#   C  a plain launch (no command asked for) still gets an interactive shell and
#      no command is forwarded to the agent - the default shell that
#      `Config.finalize` fills in must NOT be mistaken for an explicit request.
#   D  a launch command survives session restore (T406).
#   E  a SECOND launch against an already-running instance forwards its
#      `-e` command and `--working-directory` instead of dropping them (T487):
#      the AlreadyRunning arm used to forward a bare `new-window` with a null
#      payload, so the running instance opened an empty window and the command
#      vanished with exit 0 and no log line.
#   F  a command that is nothing but a BARE SHELL (`--command=powershell`, the
#      launch spelling of `command = powershell` in the config) runs that shell
#      UN-NESTED with shell integration (T514). Pre-fix the agent ran
#      `cmd /c powershell`: the user's shell nested under a hidden cmd.exe, the
#      integration argv rewrite dropped, and +list frozen on the wrapper's cwd.
#
# Non-interactive; asserts and exits nonzero on any failure. Hermetic: a per-run
# $env:LOCALAPPDATA + GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN (so no real session-layout is
# restored over the window under test), and it ONLY ever kills ghoztty /
