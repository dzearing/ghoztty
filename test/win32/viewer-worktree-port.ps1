# T638/T650 acceptance: leg 2 of viewer worktree provenance -- localhost:PORT ->
# the listening process -> that process's working directory.
#
# What is asserted:
#
#   - a pane on `http://localhost:<port>` where a server IS listening resolves
#     the SERVER's checkout, not the pane's origin directory. The two are
#     deliberately different working trees, so this can only pass if the port
#     lookup actually ran.
#   - a pane on a port where NOBODY is listening falls back to the pane's
#     origin directory (leg 3), rather than erroring, hanging, or going blank.
#   - a listener whose working directory is in NO repository resolves to no
#     worktree -- leg 2 won and honestly found nothing. This is Mac's shape
#     (`ViewerWorktree.candidateDirectory` returns the cwd and lets git decide),
#     not a fall-through to the origin, and it is the third distinct outcome the
#     same URL shape can produce.
#   - a pane opened on a port with NO listener picks up a dev server started
#     afterwards, on its own, with no navigation and no reopen (T650). This is
#     what the provenance cache's 15s TTL exists for, and it is the one arm the
#     TTL -- rather than the lookup -- is load-bearing in.
#   - the resolution never wedges the UI: every case answers inside the poll
#     window and the app is still alive and serving IPC at the end.
#
# ORACLE: the same one T633's `viewer-worktree.ps1` uses, and for the same
# reason (native chrome on a background desktop cannot be screenshotted) --
#     viewer worktree pane=<id> feedback=shown|hidden worktree=<path>
# emitted from `pushWorktree`, the exact code path that hands the nav bar its
# feedback button.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROLS: the three cases run against ONE app in ONE run and produce
# three DIFFERENT answers (the temp repo / this repo / nothing). A run that
# resolved nothing at all, or resolved everything to the origin, fails -- which
# is what keeps a green-and-empty pass impossible.
