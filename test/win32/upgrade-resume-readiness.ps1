# The upgrade's resume must wait for the pane and retry (tracker T439).
#
# What went wrong: delivering T428 on 2026-08-03, the swap and all three install
# locations verified OK, and then the resume typed its prompt into a pane that
# had re-attached one second earlier. The arrival gate never saw the prompt come
# back intact, the run exited 1, and the loop was dead. The same shape had
# already failed at 09:04 and 10:44 that day - three deliveries, one cause.
#
# The cause is that `+list --json` presence was the ONLY readiness gate. A pane
# is listed the moment restore builds its surface, while the agent is still
# replaying the session ring into it. `--when-idle` does not cover the gap
# either: it returns as soon as two consecutive reads match, and a pane whose
# content has not arrived yet reads as empty, unchanged, and therefore idle.
#
# Sections (all pure - no app, no pane, no upgrade run):
#   A  Wait-LoopPaneReady: what counts as ready, and the pre-fix oracle showing
#      why an empty pane is the most convincing "idle" of all.
#   B  Send-LoopPromptVerified: one miss is retried, the composer is cleared
#      between attempts, and a prompt that never arrives is never submitted.
#   C  the watchdog handoff: -Force overrides a healthy-looking lock, and
#      -ResumePromptFile keeps caller text off argv.
#   D  the upgrade script is wired to all of it - including T438's framed
#      submit, since the gate above is what forces the submit into a second
#      call that no CLI-side framing can reach.
