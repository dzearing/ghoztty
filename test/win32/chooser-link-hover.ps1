# Machine-chooser account-link hover acceptance (T315).
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\chooser-link-hover.ps1
#
# T311 built the chooser's signed-in "Sign Out" LINK and drove its hover from
# the dialog's WM_SETCURSOR: the message names the window under the pointer, so
# "entered the link" and "moved off it onto something else in the dialog" were
# the same one test. What that could not see is the pointer going from the link
# STRAIGHT OUT of the window - no further WM_SETCURSOR arrives at all, and the
# underline stayed lit until the pointer came back. The link sits a margin in
# from the client's top-right corner, so "up or right and you are out" is the
# easy path, not a corner case.
#
# T315 puts a TrackMouseEvent(TME_LEAVE) subclass on the LINK. On the DIALOG it
# would be wrong: while the pointer is over a child, the parent is not the
# window under the cursor, so the parent's leave fires the moment the pointer
# ENTERS the link - which would clear the hover on entry and "fix" the sticking
# by deleting the feature. That inverted failure is exactly what the positive
# control below exists to catch.
#
# What this script asserts, by measuring PAINT (the underline is an underlined
# FONT, so hovering strictly adds ink to the link's rect):
#
#   1. baseline - the link paints, unhovered and unfocused, with some ink;
#   2. positive control - WM_SETCURSOR naming the link adds ink (the underline
#      appears). A leave-on-entry regression fails here, not silently;
#   3. the fix - WM_MOUSELEAVE at the LINK takes the ink back to baseline. On a
#      pre-T315 binary the link has no subclass, WM_MOUSELEAVE reaches the stock
#      BUTTON proc, `link_hot` is never cleared and the ink stays elevated;
#   4. it is repeatable - a second enter/leave cycle behaves the same, so the
#      subclass is not a one-shot;
#   5. the link still WORKS after being subclassed - it keeps its label, its
#      geometry and its tab stop (a subclass that ate messages would show here).
#
# Why posted messages rather than a real pointer: TrackMouseEvent watches the
# REAL cursor (T233), and SetCursorPos is refused off the input desktop, so no
# automated run on the test desktop can HOLD a hover. Posting WM_SETCURSOR sets
# the state the real message would, without arming the tracker that would
# immediately un-set it; posting WM_MOUSELEAVE at the link is byte-for-byte the
# message Windows delivers when the pointer leaves. Neither shortcut fakes the
# thing being measured, which is the app's own repaint.
#
# T217/T218: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop, so it never takes the user's
# foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed. Capture is PrintWindow, the
# only path that works there, and since T942 the SYNCHRONOUS one: the chooser
# paints the frame itself in answer to WM_PRINTCLIENT (T940) instead of DWM
# handing back a copy of the composited surface that may not be finished. The
# chooser is GDI-painted chrome so it captures for real (the OpenGL terminal
# surface, the one thing PrintWindow flattens, is not involved).
#
# The account store is redirected to a temp DPAPI blob (GHOSTTY_ACCOUNT_STORE)
# so the box's real account is never read or written. Only ever touches ghoztty
# processes running from this repo's zig-out.
