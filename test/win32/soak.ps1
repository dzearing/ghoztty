# Long-context soak harness (T53a/T53b): Claude-Code-like load against the
# release-staging build, fully IPC-driven (no keyboard injection, safe to
# run beside real work). Isolated on a run-unique '-soak<pid>' pipe suffix.
#
# Load mix (all --shell=cmd panes in one named window):
#   soak-stream : endless `type` of an 8MB file  -> sustained visible stream
#   soak-altscr : PS loop toggling ESC[?1049h/l  -> alt-screen churn (TUI-like)
#   soak-grow   : 150k numbered lines            -> big scrollback, then idle
#   (original)  : idle cmd prompt                -> input-latency probe target
#
# Sampled every 15s: WorkingSet, PrivateBytes, Handles, Threads, GDI/USER
# objects, Responding. Every 60s: input-latency probe (+send-keys marker ->
# poll +read until visible). End: big-scrollback +read latency, GHOZTTY_PERF
# telemetry slice from the app log, assertions, CSV + report under
# %TEMP%\ghoztty-soak\<stamp>\.
#
# Usage:
#   soak.ps1                      # 30-minute bounded soak, foreground
#   soak.ps1 -Minutes 5           # quick smoke
#   soak.ps1 -Minutes 240 -Detach # relaunch self detached (T53b long run)
#
# The sampling loop below prints NOTHING between its start and its verdict, by
# design - it samples counters every 15s and only speaks when something is
# wrong. So an unattended runner sees a silent 30-minute process, which is what
# the declaration on the next line is for: scripts\suite-run.ps1 reads it and
# gives this script its own cap instead of the 600s one that killed it and
# scored it `stall` on every sweep (T1125). 30 minutes of soak, plus the

# --- Renderer telemetry grading (T1147) ---------------------------------------
# The `perf` sampler reports once a SECOND PER PANE, and this window has four
# panes of which one is a deliberately idle latency-probe target. An idle
# unfocused pane legitimately redraws about once a second, so it emits `fps=1`
# for essentially every window of the run - and there are more of those windows
# than loaded ones. Every statistic taken over the pooled population therefore
# describes HOW MANY PANES HAPPENED TO BE IDLE rather than how the renderer
# coped: the original `median fps >= 20` read 1 and failed (T1147), and T1158's
# `p90 >= 30` only avoided that by picking a percentile above the idle mass,
# which is still an inference about the population rather than a measurement of
# the panes under load.
#
# Since T1147 each sample NAMES ITS PANE (`perf pane=<uuid> fps=...`), so the
# grading is done where the load actually is: group by pane, map the ids back to
# the names this script gave them, and grade the panes it deliberately loaded.
# The idle probe pane is reported - which is what turns "the fps=1 population is
# idle panes" from an inference into a measurement - and graded by nothing.
