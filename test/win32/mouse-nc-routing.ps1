# T263 acceptance: Send-TestMouse routes a click the way Windows routes it.
#
# Windows decides which FAMILY of mouse message a point produces by asking the
# window WM_NCHITTEST first: HTCLIENT produces WM_LBUTTONDOWN & co., anything
# else produces the WM_NC* twin with the hit code in wparam. Until T263 the
# harness only ever posted the client form, so every click on the caption band
# - which since T254 is client PIXELS the window claims back through its hit
# test - reached no handler at all. It looked like nothing happened, which is
# indistinguishable from a broken product: T260 lost 17 assertions to it while
# F10 and the pixel probes passed, and each script that hit it grew its own
# hand-rolled WM_NCHITTEST + WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN pair to work around it.
#
# What this asserts, and how:
#
#   A. THE DECISION. Get-TestMouseRoute reports the target's own answer at a
#      point: HTMINBUTTON over minimize, HTCAPTION over the empty band,
#      HTCLIENT over the terminal. That is the input to the routing, read from
#      the app rather than modelled, so a button that MOVED reads as a moved
#      button instead of as an action that did not happen.
#   B. THE EFFECT. A plain `Send-TestMouse -Action click` on the minimize
#      button iconifies the window - no NC messages anywhere in the script.
#   C. THE OLD BEHAVIOR IS THE CONTROL. `-Client` at the SAME point does
#      nothing at all, which is the pre-T263 harness reproduced on demand. It
#      is what makes B's pass evidence about the routing rather than about the
#      button, and it is what keeps the escape hatch honest.
#   D. THE ROUTING DOES NOT OVER-CLAIM. A click on the empty caption band
#      (HTCAPTION) presses no button: the window is not iconified, not
#      maximized, not moved, not closed, the app still answers, and the NEXT
#      button click still works. A rule that turned every caption click into a
#      button press would be worse than no rule.
#   E. THE CLIENT PATH IS UNTOUCHED. A click on a terminal surface still goes
#      as a client message and still moves keyboard focus to that pane - the
#      oracle every mouse-driven script in this suite already depends on.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: -NegativeControl forces B's click through -Client (i.e.
# runs it as the pre-T263 harness) and MUST fail.
#
# Runs on the background test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so it
# never takes the user's foreground. Only touches ghoztty processes running
# from this repo's zig-out.
