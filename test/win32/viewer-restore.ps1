# T90h acceptance: viewer panes survive a session restore.
#
# A viewer owns no agent session, so there is nothing for restore to ATTACH to -
# re-opening its recorded location IS its restore. That makes this a different
# oracle from session-reattach.ps1 (which proves the SAME pids come back) and it
# gets its own script rather than a section there: this one needs
# session-persistence ON and a viewer in the tree, and session-reattach's F10/F11
# are knowingly RED on T223, so a new assertion buried in it could never be read
# as a clean pass.
#
# What is asserted, in two halves:
#
#   CAPTURE (A-C) - the manifest records a viewer leaf as a viewer:
#     A. a mixed window (viewer + terminal + viewer) captures three leaves, of
#        which exactly two carry kind=viewer, and the terminal leaf carries a
#        session_id while neither viewer does.
#     B. each viewer leaf records viewer_location, viewer_home_location and
#        viewer_origin_directory (the CLI seeds the last one with the caller's
#        cwd for every --view= open), plus the pane's IPC name.
#     C. a viewer-ONLY window is captured too, including one whose file does not
#        exist - the pane the user is looking at is a real pane either way.
#
#   RESTORE (D-H) - kill ONLY the app (the agent keeps the terminal's PTY),
#   relaunch, and read the rebuilt layout back through +list --json:
#     D. the mixed window comes back with all three panes in the same order and
#        the same kinds - the viewer arms of the restore walk (window root, and
#        a split whose new pane is a viewer).
#     E. each restored viewer is pointed at the location it was showing, and
#        kept its IPC name.
#     F. the viewer-only window comes back AT ALL. This is the never-all-dead
#        rule: it has no session-backed leaf, so the pre-T90h reachability probe
#        would have dropped it as "every session gone".
#     G. the missing-file viewer restores as a live viewer pane (the error card
#        is IN the page) rather than being skipped.
#     H. the terminal in the mixed window re-ATTACHed rather than re-OPENing -
#        the positive control that this script did not simply rebuild everything
#        from scratch, which would make D-G true for the wrong reason.
#
#   NO AGENT (J) - T398. Kill the app AND the agent, point the agent binary
#   override at a path that does not exist, and relaunch. Restore used to
#   resolve the connection FIRST and give up without one - correct for a
#   terminal (there is nothing to ATTACH to) and true of no viewer pane at all,
#   so a manifest whose windows are viewers was dropped for a reason that
#   applied to none of its leaves. Now the viewer-only window comes back at its
#   recorded location, the mixed window comes back with its terminal degraded to
#   a fresh local pane in place, and a terminal-ONLY window would still be
#   dropped (its every leaf is a gone session). J5/J6 are the controls that no
#   agent quietly came back to make any of it true the easy way.
#
# Hermetic: per-run LOCALAPPDATA, per-run agent binary override, a private IPC
# pipe suffix, and it only ever kills ghoztty processes launched from this
# repo's zig-out. Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop, so it never takes the
# user's foreground.
