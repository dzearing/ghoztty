.SYNOPSIS
    T586 acceptance - an acceptance script that cannot START must not reach the
    tree unnoticed.

.DESCRIPTION
    `chrome-theme.ps1` shipped on 2026-08-07 calling `Test-ExeIsDebugBuild`, a
    function that exists nowhere in this repo, and died at line 299 before its
    first assertion. It stayed that way for a week: nothing runs these scripts
    but a person deciding to, and a script that cannot start looks exactly like
    a script nobody ran.

    Three sections:

      A. The analyzer (`lib\CommandResolveAudit.ps1`) against fixtures, both
         directions - the T586 shape is named, and every way this suite
         legitimately reaches a helper (a local function, a dot-sourced
         `Join-Path $PSScriptRoot` library, an expandable `"$Repo\..."` path, a
         function pulled out of another script by `Invoke-Expression`) resolves
         quietly. An analyzer that reports thirty innocent files is an analyzer
         nobody runs, so the quiet direction is checked as hard as the loud one.

      B. The sweep over `test\win32\*.ps1`. Every command name every acceptance
         script writes down must resolve. This is the assertion with the value;
         A is what makes it trustworthy.

      C. `-TeethCheck` - the negative control. It plants the exact 2026-08-07
         defect (a call to a helper that does not exist) into a real file in
         the suite directory and requires section B's sweep to go RED naming
         it, then removes it. A check never observed failing is not a check.

    One `ALL PASS` / `N FAILURE(S)` line last, per the house convention.
