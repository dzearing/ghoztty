# T90b/T374 acceptance: viewer panes on win32.
#
# The script that grows across the whole Phase K band (pane-banner.ps1 model).
# T374 flipped the biggest assertion in it: `+new-window --view=<url>` and
# `+split --view=<url>` now BUILD a real viewer pane in web mode, where they
# used to be refused outright. What is asserted:
#
#   - a web `--view` creates a pane whose leaf reports `"type":"viewer"` and
#     the `url` it was opened with, renders in a `GhozttyViewer` host window,
#     and prints a `view:` row in the human `+list`.
#   - the terminal-only verbs (`+read`, `+send-keys`, `+set-state`,
#     `+set-banner`) refuse a viewer target with the Mac's string and exit 1,
#     while `+close` takes it silently -- the line between "this pane has no
#     shell" and "this pane is a normal tree citizen".
#   - a FILE `--view` (T90e) builds a pane too -- markdown, code, and a path
#     that does not exist, which opens a pane carrying the error IN the page
#     rather than refusing. `+list` cannot see inside a WebView2, so what is
#     asserted here is the pane's identity and location; that the file's
#     CONTENT reaches the page is the win32 lane's live "host floor" test,
#     which reads a two-heading markdown file's headings back up T375's
#     bridge.
#   - a viewer NAMES itself (T383): the leaf's `title` is the file's basename
#     (or the location, for a host-less URL like `about:blank`), that name
#     reaches the window caption through the T92 pane->tab->titlebar chain, and
#     the human `view:` row prints it. A website's real `document.title`
#     arriving over `DocumentTitleChanged` is the win32 lane's live test --
#     nothing out here can see inside a WebView2.
#   - `+reload` (T390) reloads a viewer pane and a viewer-focused window, and
#     refuses a terminal pane and a terminal-focused window with the Mac's two
#     DIFFERENT strings. That it really re-rendered (and did not just return
#     success) is read out of the GUI's own log: the missing-file viewer files
#     a second "cannot read file" line when its content is re-rendered.
#   - `--view` + `--command`/`-e` is rejected with the MAC string. That is the
#     only remaining `--view` refusal; the interim "file viewers are not yet
#     supported on Windows" error was deleted with T90e.
#   - `+list --json` carries the additive `"type"` / `"url"` pane fields on
#     every leaf, which is what `src/cli/list.zig` reads to render a `view:`
#     row. Terminals report `"terminal"` / null, exactly as the Mac server
#     encodes them (IPCMessage.swift:103-104).
#
# Oracles, and why each has a POSITIVE CONTROL: every "nothing was created"
# assertion here is trivially true if the IPC path is simply broken -- a green
# and empty run (T216's lesson). So each rejection is paired with the same verb
# WITHOUT `--view`, which must create exactly what the rejected one did not.
#
# `about:blank` is the location the created-pane cases use, deliberately: it is
# the one URL that reaches `Navigate` without a network, so a box with no route
# out still exercises the whole path (P11 makes it a product feature too).
#
# Relative/absolute `--view=` path resolution is mostly NOT asserted here: it
# happens entirely CLI-side before the request is sent, is invisible from the
# outside (the error text does not echo the path), and is unit tested in the
# none-runtime lane -- `src/cli/view_arg.zig`, including the `C:\...` and UNC
# cases that the retired `rest[0] == '/'` test called relative. The one leg
# asserted here is `~` expansion (T388, section 8a2), because the resolved
# path IS visible from outside: it comes back as the pane's `url`.
#

# steals the user's foreground. Only touches ghoztty processes running from

    # --- 11b2. T1104: a viewer chord pressed at an app that is BUSY ---------
    # The chord above crosses two processes: Chromium classifies the key from
    # the modifier state, and only then raises the event our UI thread matches
    # the binding on. Both read that state as they get to it, and on a loaded
    # box that can be a second after the keystroke.
    #
    # A real finger is still on the ctrl key by then, so the app is fine - but
    # the HARNESS faked the modifiers with SetKeyboardState and dropped them on
    # a fixed 400ms timer, which is not how hardware behaves. Past that timer
    # the chord resolves as a bare 't' and opens nothing. That is what took
    # `T394 ctrl+t from a viewer added a tab` red exactly once in a 242-script
    # sweep and left it green on every quiet re-run (T1104): a shortcut that
    # reads as broken and is not.
    #
    # Asserted here the way a user presses it: the app's UI thread is suspended
    # across the keystroke and the modifiers are held down until it catches up.
    # Its own fixture, so nothing here perturbs the tab arithmetic the T394
    # section depends on.

    #   - reload: a raw-TCP page server (relay-account.ps1's shape -- no
    #     HttpListener URL-ACL) logs one line per GET and answers no-store, so
    #     a real reload MUST produce a new hit line.
    #   - zoom: the served page mirrors window.devicePixelRatio into
    #     document.title, which DocumentTitleChanged carries into the leaf's
    #     title in `+list --json`. put_ZoomFactor changes the ratio by exactly
    #     the step, so the title is a zoom readout (ratio math, not absolute:
    #     the test desktop's DPI scale is part of the number).
    #   - address bar: the focused hwnd becomes the nav bar's EDIT
    #     (Get-TestFocusedWindow), and the pane count does NOT move -- the
    #     negative that proves ctrl+d outranked its global split-right.
    # T157's lesson: the terminal-side ctrl+d split comes FIRST as the
    # positive control that chords are being delivered at all.
