# One warm connection per remote machine, not one per roster fetch (T461).
#
# WHAT CHANGED. The chooser's detail pane used to dial the relay, run
# LIST_SESSIONS, and FREE the connection on every single roster fetch of a remote
# machine - so N refetches of one machine cost N WebSocket upgrades and N relay
# authentications, and there was nowhere to hang anything that has to keep
# listening. `App.machine_pool` now owns ONE connection per endpoint, the chooser
# holds a lease on the machine it is showing, and every fetch BORROWS that
# connection.
#
# THE ORACLE IS THE RELAY'S REQUEST LOG, not the app's own account of itself.
# `lib\FakeRelay.ps1` logs a line per `/v1/client/connect`, so the number of
# dials is counted on the far side of the wire by something that has no idea what
# the pool is. The app log supplies the other half of the pair - how many roster
# LOADS those dials served - because "one dial" is only good news if the fetches
# really happened. A run where the refetches silently did not fire would pass a
# dial count of 1 and prove nothing; C asserts both numbers.
#
# THE REFETCH DRIVER. Pressing Down while the LAST row is selected re-runs
# `refreshDetail` on the SAME machine (`clampSelection` clamps to the row it is
# already on), which is a `refresh_in_place` roster fetch. So the directory here
# lists exactly ONE device: the rows are [This PC, dev-remote], and every Down
# after the first is another fetch of dev-remote with no selection change.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   A  setup control: the app lists our device, and one remote window is open
#      through the relay so the machine really has a session to list
#   B  selecting the device row loads its roster over a pooled connection
#   C  five more fetches of that machine cost ZERO further dials (and really
#      were five more fetches)
#   D  closing the chooser releases the last lease and drops the connection -
#      a browse must not leave a socket open to every machine clicked through
#   E  the control that makes C mean something: a SECOND chooser dials again,
#      and its roster loads. If the pool had simply stopped dialing, C would
#      still pass and E could not.
#   F  arrowing AWAY from the machine and back also re-dials (same policy as D,
#      measured while one chooser stays open)
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop and never takes the user's
# foreground. T248: the repo's agent and app are killed at setup and the app is
# launched with persistence off.
