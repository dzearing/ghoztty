# T1178 acceptance: the Windows in-app update (download + apply the MSI).
#
# T24 gave Windows an update NOTIFICATION. This is the other half: the app
# finds the release's .msi asset, downloads it into a per-lineage staging
# directory, refuses anything that is not a package, and hands it to a
# detached applier that waits for the app to exit, lets msiexec replace the
# install, and relaunches. The decisions are unit-tested in
# src/apprt/win32/update_apply.zig; this script drives the parts that need a
# real process on a real box.
#
# Everything runs off canned file:// feeds and a canned file:// "package", so
# nothing here publishes, downloads from GitHub, or installs over the user's
# Ghoztty. The one thing deliberately NOT exercised is msiexec succeeding:
# that needs a signed, versioned MSI and would replace the installed app.
# Instead the applier is driven to the point of running msiexec against a
# package msiexec REJECTS, and the assertions are that it got there, that it
# survived the rejection, and that it still relaunched the terminal.
#
# Scenarios (each = one GUI launch, stderr captured; Debug builds use the
# console subsystem so std.log lands on stderr):
#   1. feed with an .msi asset       -> available + pre-downloaded + staged
#   2. asset that is not a package   -> refused, nothing staged
#   3. feed with only the zip asset  -> available, notify-only (no staging)
#   4. --auto-update=check           -> available, no background download
#   5. --auto-update=off             -> no check at all
#   6. leftover sidelined image      -> swept at launch
#   7. applier with a malformed spec -> does nothing, exit 2
#   8. applier with a real spec      -> waits, runs msiexec, relaunches
#   9. applier inside the install dir -> refuses, relaunches
#  11. the repo build survived the run  (T1268; -NegativeControl proves it can
#      score red — a stray planted before section 6 is swept by the app itself,
#      so the only honest way to observe the alarm is to arm it where the
#      damage actually happened: after the applier arms have run)
