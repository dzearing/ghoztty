# T969 acceptance: a pane printing FASTER than the holder retains still has a
# recoverable window - scrollback is saved on VOLUME, not only on a timer.
#
# In the user's terms: after T911, a crash of the background session manager
# gives you back everything printed since scrollback was last saved. But it was
# only saved every 30 seconds, and only about a megabyte of unsaved output can
# be held anywhere in the meantime - so a pane in the middle of a noisy build
# printed past that between two saves and the OLDEST of it was dropped to make
# room. The pane you were watching was fine; what a crash could hand back was
# not. The panes that print the most are exactly the ones whose recovery is
# worth the most, which is why this is the case worth closing.
#
# So this harness measures the RING SNAPSHOT FILE on disk, like its T911 sibling
# `holder-durable.ps1` - the file a fresh viewer replays from is the thing that
# had the hole - but it overruns the holder's replay ring before the crash
# instead of staying inside it.
#
# SCALED-DOWN NUMBERS, deliberately. The shipped pair is a 1 MB holder ring and
# a snapshot due at 512 KB of unsaved output; this run sets 64 KB and 32 KB via
# the agent's env knobs. Same ratio, same mechanism, and the whole flood is over
# in a second or two - printing a megabyte through a ConPTY would take long
# enough to race the 30-second timer this harness has to stay inside, which would
# make the control arm measure the timer rather than the trigger. That the
# SHIPPED numbers hold the same ratio is pinned where it belongs, as a unit test
# over the two constants (`pty_holder_child.zig`).
#
# THREE numbers decide whether this harness measures anything, not two (T1116).
# The marker has to land in the gap between the holder's retention and the
# AGENT's output ring: past the holder (or the holder alone could hand it back,
# and the volume trigger is not what saved it) but still inside the ring (or no
# snapshot can reach it, because a snapshot writes the ring as it stands). The
# first version of this script sized the flood at "four times the holder ring"
# in the bytes it TYPED - and a ConPTY does not pass those bytes through, it
# re-renders: 256 KB of payload arrived as more than 2 MB, overran the agent's
# own ring, and the marker was gone from the only buffer a snapshot could have
# written. B4 and C3 read as "the flush never fires" when in fact it fired
# throughout and had nothing left to save.
#
# So the flood is sized in what the ring actually RECORDS, the placement is
# ASSERTED rather than assumed (B3b/B3c below, measured from the snapshot file's
# own length), and the agent ring is pinned by env so an inherited
# GHOSTTY_AGENT_RING_BYTES cannot move the target silently.
#
# Sections:
#   A. Baseline: a holder-backed pane, and PROOF that ring snapshots are running
#      in this run - a first marker typed and observed landing in a .ring file.
#      That also synchronizes the clock: a snapshot just happened, so the whole
#      30-second interval is available for section B.
#   B. The overrun. A second marker is typed, confirmed on screen and confirmed
#      ABSENT from disk; then enough is printed to push several times the
#      holder's retention through the pane, MEASURED off the snapshot file
#      rather than counted in typed bytes. THE assertion: the marker reaches a
#      .ring file well inside the periodic interval, because the volume trigger
#      fired, not the timer.
#   C. The crash. The session manager is hard-killed and the replacement adopts
#      the surviving holder. The marker is still on disk - the holder dropped it
#      long ago, so nothing but the volume-triggered snapshot could have kept it.
#
# `-NegativeControl` runs the SAME build with GHOZTTY_AGENT_SNAPSHOT_VOLUME_BYTES=0,
# the off switch for the volume trigger, and asserts the marker is LOST. That is
# a real measurement of this box rather than an inverted assertion: if the
# control arm also keeps the marker, this harness is not measuring what it
# claims (the likeliest cause being a periodic snapshot landing inside section
# B's window, which would make both arms pass).
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA, a private IPC endpoint (lib\Isolation),
# GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN pinned to the agent under test, and only processes
# whose ExecutablePath is the exe/agent under test are ever stopped - never the
# user's installed release, which owns their live sessions.
