# Machine-chooser management-menu acceptance (tracker T176, the behavioral
# half of T173): the per-row "..." menu and the two relay account operations
# behind it.
#
# Mac's `managementActions` (MachineChooserView.swift:1114) is reachable two
# ways - the ellipsis button in the detail header and a right-click on a
# master-list row - and both show the same items, derived from the row. The
# Local row has no menu at all. This drives the REAL GUI against a stateful
# fake relay and asserts:
#
#   1. the "..." button is hidden on the Local row and shown on a device row;
#   2. clicking it opens a popup menu whose items are exactly Host Settings...
#      | separator | Rename... | separator | Remove from Account... (mac's
#      order; T174 built the store behind the first item, and its behavior is
#      host-settings.ps1's - this script owns the menu SHAPE);
#   3. a right-click on a row opens the same menu (and selects that row);
#   4. Rename... opens a prompt SEEDED with the current name, and committing it
#      PATCHes /v1/client/devices/<id> with {"name":...} - proven by the relay
#      recording the method, path and body - after which the list re-lists;
#   5. Remove from Account... confirms FIRST, and Enter on that confirmation
#      cancels (destructive default), with no DELETE sent;
#   6. choosing Remove for real DELETEs the device and the row disappears.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\chooser-menu.ps1
#
# T218 (batch 5): migrated onto the BACKGROUND test desktop
# (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so the run never takes the user's
# foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed. The private win32 driver
# (CmDrv) is gone; what remains of it is the HMENU reader below, because
# GetMenuItemCount/GetMenuStringW/GetMenuState take a menu HANDLE and a menu is
# not a desktop object (T218 batch 4's rule: ask what the call takes - HWND goes
# through the harness, HMENU does not).
#
# What the migration changed beyond the mechanics:
#
#   * It no longer SKIPs. The whole drive used to be wrapped in "if the
#     foreground grab aborted, SKIP", so a busy box scored a green run that had
#     asserted nothing. On the test desktop the chord always lands and a missing
#     chooser is a SETUP FAIL.
#   * Clicks are POSTED at the window that would really have received them: the
#     "..." BUTTON control for the button path, and the LISTBOX for the
#     right-click (MachineChooser.zig's list subclass handles WM_RBUTTONDOWN /
#     WM_RBUTTONUP itself and reads the row out of its own lparam, so a posted
#     click at list-client coordinates is the same evidence a real one is).
#     Neither menu entry point reads the cursor - openRowMenuFromButton anchors
#     off GetWindowRect and the right-click path off its own lparam - so nothing
#     here depends on SetCursorPos, which is dead off the input desktop.
#   * Typing into the rename field is WM_CHAR through Send-TestControlText (the
#     standard-control convention), which still lands on the EDIT's own input
#     path, so "typing replaces the pre-selected seed" is unchanged as a claim.
#   * Dialog keys are posted at the dialog: ConfirmDialog runs a NESTED modal
#     pump that filters WM_KEYDOWN for hwnds it owns (ConfirmDialog.zig:549), so
#     Enter/Tab reach handleKey without the dialog manager.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts the destructive-default assertion ("Enter on the
# Remove confirmation sends no DELETE") to expect a DELETE, which MUST fail; it
# is how a run proves the wire log still discriminates.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out.
