# T757 acceptance: a Windows path printed into a pane is a LINK.
#
# The fix is one shared-core regex (`src/config/url.zig`), asserted
# exhaustively in the `none` lane. What that lane cannot answer is whether the
# terminal surface on this box actually finds a Windows path in its own screen
# contents and treats it as a link, which is the thing the user complained
# about. This script asks the running app.
#
# THE ORACLE is a ctrl+RIGHT-click, which SELECTS rather than opens. A
# right-press with the default `right-click-action = context-menu` runs
# `linkAtPos` and, when it finds a link, selects exactly that link (else the
# plain word) before showing the menu - so the selection it leaves behind is
# the terminal's own answer to "what link is here", readable through ctrl+c
# and the clipboard. Nothing is launched, which a left-click would do.
#
# Ctrl because that is the configured `hover_mods` of the default link: the
# same modifier a user holds to click one.
#
# Column 0 is what makes the answer unambiguous. `:` is a word boundary
# (Config.SelectionWordChars) and `\`, `/` and `.` are not, so clicking the
# `Q` of `Q:\Users\...`:
#
#   * with link detection  -> the whole path, `Q:\Users\David\clip.mp4`
#   * without it (word)    -> the single character `Q`
#
# Those cannot be confused, and section C is the control that proves the
# difference is link detection and not a fat word: the same click at the same
# column on `Z: not a path here` must come back as the lone `Z`.
#
# UNC (`\\server\share\a.txt`) is deliberately NOT probed here. It carries no
# word-boundary character, so word-select and link-select return the same
# string and the assertion would pass on a build with no Windows branch at
# all. It is covered by `test "url regex"` in the none lane.

# Fill EVERY row of the screen with one line, so a probe row lands on it. `cls`
# first: without it the rows above are whatever the shell's startup printed.
#
# ONE shell command emits all `count` copies (T916). Sending `echo <text>`
# `count` times instead - which is what this did until 2026-09-20 - leaves the
# screen as a repeating THREE-row block (the echoed command line, its output,
# a blank), and only one row in three carries the text. A fixed-pitch walk
# down that screen is an aliasing problem: with `-Rows 8` the probe pitch is
# about 2.1 rows against a 3-row period, and which phase each probe lands on
# depends on where the content happened to stop. That is why T802's section E
# could see nothing but prompt rows over 8 probes, and why the same points
# answered differently across two passes - a probe that finds no selection
# sends `^C` through to the shell, which prints a prompt and scrolls the
# screen under the next one. With every row holding the text, no probe can
# miss and nothing scrolls.
#
# `for /l` is cmd.exe, which is the shell this app launches by default
# (IpcHandlers.zig: `command-shell` orelse "cmd.exe") and the one `cls` above
# already assumes. `@echo` keeps the loop body off the screen. If that default
# ever moves, the transport control below fails loudly rather than quietly

Did the walk that just ran actually reach a content row on EVERY probe?

`$script:lastWalk` is the raw per-probe answer, before the de-duplication the
walks return - so a probe that found nothing is visible here as the sentinel
and a probe that found the wrong row is visible as its text. A probe that
selects nothing is the shape T916 is about: it means the pitch landed on a
blank or a prompt row, the `^C` that follows goes to the shell, and the screen
scrolls under the next probe.

T802: the same probe driven by the gesture a USER makes - a plain
double-click, no modifier - and read the same way, through ctrl+c.

-Gesture atomic posts the OS's own double-click shape (move, down, up, down,
up in one burst), which is what a mouse delivers.

-Gesture jitter posts the four button messages as four separate calls, and
since Send-TestMouse puts a WM_MOUSEMOVE at the point ahead of every button
message, that lands a pointer event BETWEEN the second press and its release.
That is a trackpad double-tap wobbling inside the clicked cell, and it is the
half of T802 that lives in the shared core (`samePin`) rather than in the
win32 message pump: without the guard, the move alone re-selects the word and
the link selection the press made is gone before the release.

No modifier is held, so `over_link` is false and the release cannot open
anything - nothing is launched at the user's browser (T594's rule).
