# go-loop guard acceptance (tracker T139): the parity loop must never run twice
# and must never stay dead.
#
# Sections:
#   A. Lock lifecycle: free -> acquire -> held -> heartbeat -> release -> free.
#   B. Second session refused: a DIFFERENT pane, while the recorded owner is a
#      live process with a fresh heartbeat, gets BUSY (exit 3) and the lock file
#      still names the first owner. This is the two-loops-at-once case.
#   C. Same pane re-acquires (that is a /reset-context turn, not a rival) and
#      the turn counter advances.
#   D. Dead owner is taken over (reason=dead-owner) - a crash never wedges it.
#   E. Stale heartbeat is taken over (reason=stale-heartbeat) even with the
#      owner process alive - that is the turn-ended-with-a-summary case.
#   F. Pid recycling cannot hold the lock: same pid, wrong recorded start time
#      => treated as dead.
#   G. heartbeat/release from a non-owner => exit 4, lock untouched.
#   H. Watchdog decisions (dry run): healthy lock => none; stale + open task
#      files => new-window; no open task for this seat (all closed, or only
#      seat: mac left) => none; missing task dir => still re-enters; rearm
#      window not elapsed => none.
#   I. Watchdog REAL re-entry, against a live debug GUI: no lock at all =>
#      it opens a window running the resume shim (asserted by reading the
#      pane's own output back).
#   J. Watchdog REAL nudge: lock owned by a live process with a stale
#      heartbeat, its pane alive and quiet => the resume prompt is typed into
#      that pane instead of opening a second window.
#   P. The supervisor's own liveness is observable (T440): a running watchdog
#      stamps a beacon on every tick including the quiet ones, a -Once tick
#      never does, -Status reports both autostart hooks, and the every-10-minute
#      revive task is registered so a dead watchdog cannot wait for a logon.
#   Q. `status` asks the PANE when the recorded pid is dead (T440), so a claude
#      relaunched in the owning pane reads as held rather than stale-dead -
#      while `acquire` stays pid-based, on purpose.
#   T. A path typed into a pane arrives verbatim (T280): the re-entry's shim
#      path rides `+send-keys --keys-file=`, whose bytes are written with no
#      escape processing, with the old positional send as the negative control -
#      it must still arrive mangled, or the arm is measuring nothing.
#   R. A turn longer than the staleness window is not nudged (T253): the lock's
#      freshness follows the session TRANSCRIPT, which Claude Code advances by
#      itself, so a working turn is visibly alive without anybody remembering to
#      beat the heartbeat - and the nudge, when it does fire, is reset-first so
#      landing it on a live session cannot queue a second task into that context.
#   S. Stranded work (T847): paths dirty at claim time are a dead turn's work.
#      claim snapshots and reports them; `parity-tasks.ps1 validate` fails while
#      they stay dirty; `ack-stranded` hands them to an OPEN task (the ack
#      survives re-claims and dies with the task); resolving the tree deletes
#      the snapshot. All against a fixture git repo + fixture task dir.
#   W. Shared-index commit guard (T948): two sessions, one working tree, one
#      index. The 2026-08-17 swallow is reproduced against a fixture repo - A
#      stages, B commits with -A - and must be REFUSED by the pre-commit hook
#      while A holds; A's own git passes through on its key; a hold past its ttl
#      is cleared rather than obeyed; the commit path commits only its pathspec
#      and reads the result back; and `verify` still catches a foreign path in a
#      finished commit, which is what a bypassed hook leaves behind.
#   V. Boot revival (T829): after a reboot with nobody at the keyboard nothing
#      of ours can run at all, so the loop's answer is to MEASURE the gap
#      between power-on and a desktop existing, record it once per boot, and be
#      loud about it on the way back. Plus the links below that one, which are
#      ours to hold: the revive task fires AT LOGON, is not battery-gated, and
#      carries no execution time limit that would kill the watchdog it started.
#   X. The loop has an off switch and every re-entry path reads it (2026-08-23).
#   Y. The daily digest is enforced rather than remembered (T1223).
#   Z. The daily publish is on the health line, so "nothing shipped" is visible
#      in the same place as "no digest" (T1292).
#  AA. The health line measures WORK, not keystrokes (T1290): a turn that has
#      not completed inside -TurnStaleMinutes reddens the verdict however fresh
#      the pane is, so the watchdog's own nudge can no longer buy health.
#  BB. The WATCHDOG decides by that same clock (T1319): a held lock whose turn
#      has not completed is re-entered, and a composer holding unsent text is
#      read as a stalled turn rather than as activity.
#  CC. WHY the turn is not moving, and how many times that has been ignored
#      (T1483): a session blocked from OUTSIDE this box - a spend limit, a 5xx -
#      is named by both supervisors from the transcript it wrote, with the
#      instant it clears; and re-entries inside one unmoved turn are counted, so
#      180 of them cannot read like the first one.
#
# Hermetic: every lock/state/tracker file lives under a per-run temp dir, the

#
# WHY. Between 2026-09-09 09:46 and 2026-09-12 01:11 the loop did no work for
# 63.5 hours. Nothing failed to detect it: the watchdog logged STALLED(by=turn)
# 716 times, turn_age climbing from 604m to 3,804m, and it nudged the pane 180
# times. Every nudge was answered in under a second by:
#
#   "You've hit your monthly spend limit - raise it at claude.ai/settings/usage
#    - your weekly limit resets Sep 12, 1am (America/Los_Angeles)"
#
# and the loop came back at 01:11 because the quota reset at 01:00, not because
# the 180th nudge differed from the 179th. Two things were missing, and neither
# is the detector:
#   1. The REASON. It was machine-readable the whole time - Claude Code writes
#      that reply into the session transcript with `isApiErrorMessage: true` and
#      a `quotaLimits.resetsAt` epoch - and neither supervisor read it. The
#      health note said "read the pane before theorising"; nobody was standing
#      in front of the pane for three days.
#   2. The COUNT. 180 identical re-entries inside one unmoved turn read exactly
#      like the first one. A repetition nobody totals is a repetition nobody
#      sees.
#
# The fixture below is the real thing: entries shaped exactly like the ones in
# transcript c41566bf for 2026-09-10 12:00-13:00, quotaLimits and all.
