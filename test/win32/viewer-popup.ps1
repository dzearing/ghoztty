# T163 acceptance: a `window.open()` popup becomes a real ghoztty window.
#
# Before T163 every popup was handed to the default browser, unconditionally.
# That is still the right answer for an http(s) URL -- Ghoztty's WebView2 keeps
# its own cookie store, so an authenticated site opened here renders logged out
# -- but it is the WRONG answer for the two popups a browser cannot be handed:
# a bare `window.open()` with no URL, where the script goes on to write into the
# window it was given, and a non-web scheme. Those now become their own ghoztty
# window whose single viewer pane IS the popup.
#
# What is asserted, from OUTSIDE the app:
#
#   A. setup: the opener window comes up on a page served from loopback, and it
#      is the only window. The positive control for every count below.
#   B. a second window appears with exactly one pane, `"type":"viewer"`, at
#      `about:blank` -- the popup was ADOPTED, not shelled out to a browser.
#   C. that pane's title is what the OPENER wrote through the handle
#      `window.open()` returned. This is the load-bearing claim: the write can
#      only land here if this pane is the window the runtime handed the script,
#      which is what `put_NewWindow` + a deferral buy. A pane we had merely
#      opened at the same location would be a different window, the write would
#      go nowhere, and this title would stay `about:blank`.
#   D. the popup window honors the size the opener asked for
#      (`width=520,height=680`): it is PORTRAIT and clearly smaller than the
#      opener. Deliberately non-square, because `ICoreWebView2WindowFeatures`
#      puts `Height` before `Width` in its vtable and a square request could not
#      tell a swapped pair from a correct one. A window that ignored the request
#      outright is landscape at the ordinary default, so this one assertion
#      catches both failures.
#   E. `window.close()` from the opener closes the popup window and nothing
#      else: the popup is gone from `+list --json` and the opener is still
#      there with its pane. This is `add_WindowCloseRequested` wired all the way
#      through to the pane's close.
#
# What is NOT asserted here, on purpose: the DEFAULT-BROWSER leg. Exercising it
# from a test lane would launch the user's real browser over a green run. It is
# covered in the win32 unit lane instead, by the live test "T163: a popup is
# adopted as a pane, sized, and can close itself" (ViewerPane.zig), whose last
# section routes an http popup through a link sink and asserts `browser:<url>`.
#
# The popup is driven by a page on a raw-TCP loopback server (viewer-panes.ps1's
# shape -- no HttpListener URL-ACL to register). The close is script-driven
# rather than timed: the opener polls `/gate` and only calls `close()` once this
# script drops a flag file, so C and D are read from a window that is still
# there rather than raced against a timer.
#
# Hermetic: per-run LOCALAPPDATA, a private IPC pipe suffix, and it only ever
# kills ghoztty processes launched from this repo's zig-out. Runs on the
# BACKGROUND test desktop, so it never takes the user's foreground.

# The one window that was not already open. `$script:knownTargets` is snapshotted

# (`--target=opener`).
#
# The ordering is load-bearing and was wrong until 2026-08-22 (T1103). The
# snapshot used to be taken after waiting for the opener's pane to show up in
# `+list`, and the opener's page calls `window.open()` on load -- so on a loaded
# box the popup was ALREADY registered by then and got captured into the "known"
# set. `Get-PopupWin` could then never find it again: B and C failed on a feature
# that was working (D found the same popup by its HWND title, at the size it had
