.SYNOPSIS
    build-cache acceptance (T1054): the build cache is cleared on a cadence the
    loop owns, and a near-full drive is named as a near-full drive.

.DESCRIPTION
    On 2026-08-21 D: hit exactly 0 bytes free - 31,359 entries and 1,235 GB in
    `.zig-cache\o`, which nothing had ever evicted - and every floor lane then
    died in five seconds with a bare `error: Unexpected` from zig. That message
    reads as red code, so the failure mode is not "the box is full", it is "a
    turn spends its context debugging a compiler error that is really a disk".

    Sections:

      A. The cheap state question (`Get-BuildCacheState`) against FIXTURE cache
         directories: under the limits it says ok, over the entry ceiling it
         says over and names `entries`, and the free-space trigger wins over the
         entry one when both apply.
      B. The clear is WHOLE. Pruning `o\` alone leaves Zig's manifests in `h\`
         naming outputs that no longer exist, which is how the first attempt at
         this broke the next lane with `failed to spawn build runner ...
         FileNotFound`. So: every subdirectory goes, not just `o`.
      C. `build-cache.ps1` on the wire, over fixtures - `sweep` clears an
         over-limit cache, `sweep` leaves an under-limit one ALONE (the half
         that stops this from being a daily cold rebuild), `clear` refuses
         without -Force, and every action exits 0 because this runs inside the
         claim.
      D. `floor-lane.ps1`'s disk pre-flight: with the floor set above the real
         free space it fails with the disk message and NEVER launches zig; with
         the floor at its default it does not fire on a healthy box.
      E. The claim reports it, and the cost is bounded: `go-loop-exec.ps1` calls
         the sweeper, and a state check over a large fixture cache stays well
         inside a second.
      F. The OTHER drive (T1431). Zig's C/C++ compile steps scratch in %TEMP%,
         which on this box is C: while everything the cache sweeper measures is
         on D: - so on 2026-09-07 a claim printed a terabyte free while C: held
         0.1 GB and every lane died with the same bare `error: Unexpected`.
         Two halves: the build shells scratch on the REPO's drive so a full C:
         cannot stop a build at all, and the drive %TEMP% is really on is
         measured and named so the box state is visible before a turn spends its
         context on a fake compile error.
      G. Torn generated sources (T999). Both torn-cache incidents followed a
         hard reboot and left an options.zig under `c\<hash>\` empty, full of
         NULs or cut short. The scan names exactly those shapes, skips a file
         young enough to be mid-write, `check` reports without deleting,
         `sweep` (the claim) deletes only the torn entries, and the live repo
         cache reads clean so the rule costs a healthy box nothing.

    Launches no GUI and touches no real cache: every section works on throwaway
    directories under $TEMP. Section D runs the real `floor-lane.ps1` but only
    on the path that refuses before launching anything.
