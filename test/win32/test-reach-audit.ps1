#
# isolation: none - this builds and runs the win32 TEST lane (a console test
# binary out of `.zig-cache`) and reads its string table. It launches no
# Ghoztty, takes no IPC endpoint, and touches no user state (T680 meta-check
# reads this marker).
#
# THE RULE: every `src\apprt\win32\*.zig` that contains a `test` block has that
# block executed by `zig build test -Dapp-runtime=win32`.
#
# Why it needs checking at all, and why the check is shaped the way it is, is
# written out in `lib\TestReachAudit.ps1`. The short version: Zig runs a file's
# tests only if the file's container is REFERENCED from an analyzed one, the
# hand-written `test { _ = @import("win32/X.zig"); }` list in
# `src\apprt\win32.zig` is what does the referencing, and a module left off it
# compiles, reads as covered, and is skipped in silence. T1177 measured that on
# `startup_error.zig`: a deliberately broken assertion inside it went GREEN
# through the full lane.
#
# The oracle is the compiled test binary rather than a PowerShell model of Zig's
# reachability rules - see the library header for why a model is the wrong
# answer here specifically.
#
# Sections:
#
#   A. The comparison itself, against fixtures. Cheap, no build: proves the
#      analyzer names a missing module and stays quiet on a complete set.
#   B. The sweep. Builds the lane, reads the binary it ran, and requires the
#      missing set to be EMPTY. Reports the covered count as a number.
#   C. `-TeethCheck` only: the negative control the rule is worth nothing
#      without. It removes one known-good entry from `win32.zig`'s list,
#      rebuilds, and requires section B's comparison to go red NAMING that
#      file - then puts the line back. This is a real rebuild and takes
#      minutes; it is not part of a routine run.
