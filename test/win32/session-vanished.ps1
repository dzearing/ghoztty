# T1162 acceptance: a persistent session whose shell already exited must stop
# being offered as a running one.
#
# WHAT THE USER SAW
#
# Ghoztty keeps a terminal session alive in the background so you can come back
# to it later. On 2026-08-31 six of those background sessions had their shells
# killed; a minute later `ghoztty +sessions` still reported all six as running
# against pids that no longer existed, and they were still listed the next day.
# Picking one does nothing useful - there is no process to come back to - and
# because the record is written to sessions.json it comes back on every restart,
# so the list only ever grows.
#
# WHY NOTHING NOTICED
#
# Exit detection rides the child's OUTPUT path: `SessionStore.markExited` is
# reached from exactly one place, `onChildOutput`, which the pty reader nudges
# with a zero-length call on EOF. That needs a reader. A detached session whose
# `--pty-host` holder is gone has none - no reader thread, no EOF, no nudge -
# and nothing polled. The fix is the reaper's vanished-child sweep: one process
# table snapshot every few seconds, and a session whose shell is missing from
# two consecutive snapshots is tombstoned.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
#
#   A. A named, agent-backed pane, its session id, its live shell pid, and the
#      holder serving it - plus a typed marker echoed back, so a dead session
#      later proves something rather than being how the pane always was.
#   B. Kill ONLY the app. The session detaches and must still be reported alive:
#      the positive control for persistence, and the state the bug lives in.
#   C. Reproduce the field state exactly - holder gone, shell gone, nobody
#      reading. The holder is killed first (which is what the user's agent had
#      long since lost) and the shell is confirmed out of the process table.
#   D. THE OUTCOME: within a bounded wait the agent stops reporting that session
#      as running, so nothing offers the user a session that cannot come back.
#   E. The other half, which matters just as much: a session whose shell IS
#      running is never swept. A fresh pane stays alive and interactive across
#      several sweep intervals.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT PROVE, measured rather than assumed
#
# It does not prove the SWEEP is what dropped the session. On 2026-08-31 this
# script was run against the same build with the sweep's off switch thrown
# (GHOZTTY_AGENT_VANISH_SWEEP=0) and section D still passed: killing the holder
# from OUTSIDE also tears the session down through the holder-loss path, which
# is a different mechanism reaching the same answer. The state the field bug
# needs - a session alive with no reader of any kind - is not reachable by
# killing processes from a script, so an inverted assertion here would have been
# a lie dressed as a control, and it was removed rather than kept green.
#
# So read this harness for what it measures: the user-visible OUTCOME in both
# directions, which is a real regression guard for either mechanism breaking.
# The sweep's own rules - two strikes, a pid the table cannot see, a session
# younger than the snapshot, a failed snapshot - are pinned by unit tests in
# `src\remote\agent\session.zig` against a synthetic process table, where the
# state IS constructible. A follow-up task owns building the no-reader state on
# box (the agent-handoff path is the likeliest route to it).
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA, a private IPC endpoint (lib\Isolation),
# GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN pinned to the agent under test, and only processes
# whose ExecutablePath is the exe/agent under test are ever stopped - never the
# user's installed release, which owns their live sessions.
