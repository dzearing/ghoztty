<#
.SYNOPSIS
    T450 - a crashing binary must leave a full dump and EVERY thread's
    symbolised stack, automatically.

.DESCRIPTION
    Zig's segfault handler dies in a recursive panic on this box, so a crashed
    test binary prints two lines and no stack -- and even when it works it only
    ever shows the FAULTING thread, which is the victim, not the culprit.

    This script proves the replacement end to end against a REAL access
    violation raised on a BACKGROUND thread, because that is the case that
    matters: the assertion that carries the whole task is that the capture
    contains the main thread's stack too, not just the one that faulted.

.OUTPUTS
    One `ALL PASS` / `N FAILURE(S)` line last, per the house convention.
