# T421 acceptance: the agent-refresh RELAUNCH GUARD.
#
# The defect, twice reported (T229, then again 2026-08-03): the user confirms
# the mandatory agent-restart dialog, the app ends without a crash record or a
# further log line, and NOTHING brings it back. On 2026-08-03 the box sat with
# no Ghoztty for fourteen minutes until the user launched it by hand.
#
# T229 attacked the cause and could not reproduce it in four shapes. This guards
# the OUTCOME instead: for the seconds the app spends restarting its agent, a
# detached watcher holds its process handle and starts it again if it ends
# early. Measured by OUTCOME - a process that exists, from the right exe,
# answering IPC - never by log scraping.
#
#   A: positive - app dies with the marker present => a NEW app is started from
#      the same exe, and it answers +list. The user's report, inverted.
#   B: negative control - the marker is CLEARED first (a refresh that finished)
#      => the same death relaunches nothing. Without this arm, an
#      always-relaunch bug would pass arm A.
#   C: negative control - the app is still ALIVE when the marker clears => the
#      guard exits on its own rather than lingering to fire later.
#   D: negative control - a malformed spec launches nothing and exits non-zero.
#      A guard that misreads its orders would wait on some unrelated pid.
#   E: the guard process is not a terminal: it opens no window and binds no IPC
#      endpoint, so it can never be mistaken for a second instance.
#   F: T524 - a guard jailed in a kill-on-close job relaunches an app that
#      lands OUTSIDE the job and survives the job's teardown (the production
#      failure was the guard/app dying together in a job teardown).
#
# Arm A/B/D drive the WATCHING half directly (the env var IS the interface).
# The ARMING half is covered end to end by test\win32\agent-upgrade.ps1 arm H
# (H16-H18), which runs a real destructive refresh.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA and a private IPC pipe suffix, and it
# only ever touches ghoztty processes launched from the -Exe under test.
