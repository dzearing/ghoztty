# T1031 acceptance: resizing panes does not blank them first.
#
# THE DEFECT, because it decides what this script can honestly assert.
# The user's report was "when i resize a pane, the panes flicker fairly badly
# ... it seems like we're clearing and repainting on every frame", across three
# interactions: dragging a split divider, dragging the window edge, and
# expanding/collapsing the sticky banner. All three run one layout path, and
# four things on it each put a flat background rectangle on screen ahead of the
# GL frame:
#
#   1. The container window was created without WS_CLIPCHILDREN and the pane
#      children without WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, so parent-side drawing and the
#      transient mismatched geometry of an unbatched layout pass were free to
#      land on pixels a pane owns.
#   2. The surface's WM_ERASEBKGND filled the WHOLE client with the background
#      brush unconditionally, "because the OpenGL renderer will overwrite the
#      entire client area on the next frame". The NEXT frame was the bug: the
#      erase is synchronous, the GL frame is not.
#   3. layoutNode moved each leaf with its own MoveWindow.
#   4. The "block until the renderer has presented at the new size" path was
#      gated on in_live_resize, which is only set at WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE - so the
#      divider drag and the banner toggle, neither of which is a modal size
#      loop, never took it. That is why dragging the window edge already looked
#      better than dragging a divider.
#
# THE ORACLE, and what is deliberately NOT asserted here.
# The obvious test - sample pane pixels mid-drag and fail on a flat frame - is
# a coin flip, for the two reasons banner-resize-repaint.ps1 already measured:
# off the input desktop the terminal surface does not come back from
# PrintWindow at all (Get-TestWindowPixels refuses it by name), and on it the
# window between the erase and the swap is sub-frame, so polling at ~10ms from
# another process catches it essentially never. A test that passes because the
# shutter opened at a lucky moment proves nothing.
#
# What replaces it asks the app the same question directly, and none of it is
# timing-dependent:
#
#   A. The erase DECISION, read out of the debug build's stderr: the handler
#      logs `surface erase surface=.. presented=.. fill=..` every time it runs,
#      and a surface holding a presented frame must never say fill=true. That
#      is mechanism 2, stated by the app rather than photographed.
#      Not by probing the window: WM_ERASEBKGND carries an HDC, an HDC is a
#      per-process handle, and the version of this script that sent the message
#      from here went green with the fix REVERTED - the app's FillRect was
#      writing through a handle that meant nothing on its side. Its own teeth
#      check is what caught it, which is why every erase assertion below is
#      paired with a vacuity check that the oracle is alive.
#   B. The clip styles, read back off the live windows: WS_CLIPCHILDREN on the
#      container, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS on every visible pane. That is mechanism 1,
#      and it is the pair that makes parent/sibling overpaint impossible rather
#      than merely unlikely.
#   C. Both hold across a posted divider drag and a whole-window resize, and
#      the panes still TILE the content area afterwards - so the batched
#      layout pass (mechanism 3) did not trade a flicker for a gap or an
#      overlap. T155's tiling invariant is what a stale divider line lives in.
#
#   D. The SYNCHRONOUS PRESENT, added by T1393 - mechanism 4, which nothing
#      here could see until the app was made to state it. Each layout pass logs
#      `window resize cause=.. panes=.. sync=.. fresh=.. waits=.. timeouts=..`,
#      and a pass that resized panes the user can see must have put every one
#      of them on the wait (`sync + fresh >= panes`; `fresh` is a pane with
#      nothing presented yet, for which declining is the rule). That is what
#      caught the second cause of the same reported symptom five days after
#      T1031 closed: the wait was gated on `in_live_resize` - i.e. on
#      WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE, i.e. on a MODAL SIZE LOOP - so maximize, restore,
#      Aero-snap and a title-bar double-click each resized every visible pane
#      with the anti-flicker path switched off, and section C2 above could not
#      tell, because `Set-TestWindowPos` never opens a size loop either.
#
#   E. The frame the wait CAME BACK ON, added by T1476 - the same mechanism 4,
#      one layer down. Waiting was never the whole guarantee: the wait ended on
#      the next presented frame, and the frame that lands first after a resize
#      is routinely one the renderer had ALREADY STARTED at the old size. So the
#      UI thread walked away believing the pane was showing its new size while
#      it was showing the previous one, and no timeout could see it because the
#      wait had not timed out - it had been answered by the wrong frame. The
#      renderer now stamps the size it presented at and the wait loops until
#      every pane's LAST present is the size it was resized to, inside the same
#      one-frame budget. `divider drag ... stale=N` is that number: panes whose
#      wait ended on a frame drawn for the previous size. Measured on this box
#      over a 25-tick posted drag: stale=2 timeouts=0 in the old shape,
#      stale=0 after. `GHOZTTY_RESIZE_WAIT_ANY=1` restores the old shape, which
#      is how the defect is reproduced on demand; it is not asserted here
#      because WHETHER a given tick catches an in-flight frame is a race, and a
#      test that needs a race to go its way is the thing this file's header
#      already refuses to write.
#
# Mechanism 4 no longer has "no observable this script can reach": "the pane
# blocked for a frame" is still a schedule rather than a pixel, but a schedule
# the app can be asked about. The unit half of the fix -
# WHEN the erase should still fill (a surface with no presented frame, and the
# search/palette popups that share its window class) - is
# src/apprt/win32/resize_paint.zig, run in every app-runtime lane.
#

    # changes size, and the enlarged GL surface sits there holding the flat
    # clear color until the renderer presents at the new size. That gap is
    # closed by blocking the UI thread on the renderer's frame event - and
    # until T1393 the gate on it was `in_live_resize`, i.e. WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE,
    # i.e. a MODAL SIZE LOOP.
    #
    # Which is why section C2 above passed while the user could still see the
    # blink: `Set-TestWindowPos` resizes without a size loop, so it never
    # exercised the wait at all, and neither does maximize, Aero-snap or a
    # title-bar double-click - the three gestures a person actually uses to
    # resize a whole window without dragging its edge. The pre-fix build,
    # instrumented with the oracle below, answered:
    #
    #   cause=restored  panes=2 sync=2   <- bracketed frame drag
    #   cause=maximized panes=2 sync=0   <- maximize: no guarantee
    #   cause=restored  panes=2 sync=0   <- restore:  no guarantee
    #
    # Same oracle shape as the erase decision, and for the same reason: "the
    # pane waited for its frame" is a SCHEDULE, not a pixel, so no probe in
    # another process can photograph it. The pass states it instead.
    # Four panes, not the two the sections above need: the guarantee is
    # per-pane ("every pane of the pass waited"), so a two-pane window cannot
    # tell "all of them" apart from "the active one". Sections A-C are done
