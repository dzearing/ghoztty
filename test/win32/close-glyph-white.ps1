# T528 acceptance: the close button's glyph is WHITE on its red fill.
#
# The user's report (2026-08-06): "the close X button in the top right has
# black X on hover while normal windows have white X." Every native Windows 11
# window flips the close glyph to white when the red hover fill appears; ours
# went black, at the single most-looked-at control on the window.
#
# It went black while every contrast floor passed, which is why this needs a
# PIXEL oracle and not just the palette's unit sweep. The old palette resolved
# the foreground with `contrastForeground(danger)` - the better of black and
# white against whatever red came out of the 3:1 lift off the band. On a
# mid-dark band that lift LIGHTENS `#C42B1C` past the point where white clears
# 4.5:1, and black-on-light-red is then the WCAG-correct answer. Two correct
# rules, one wrong button. `chrome_theme.dangerFillOn` now caps the fill's
# luminance so white always reads on it, and `on_danger` is white, full stop.
#
# THE BACKGROUND IS THE POINT. This launches with `--background=#202020` -
# Fluent's dark surface, and the shade a default dark theme really paints -
# because that is a band where the two answers DIFFER. On the `#000000` that
# caption-bar.ps1 uses, `#C42B1C` already clears 3:1 unadjusted and the old
# code picked white too: the arm would pass against the defect. Teeth-checked
# by reverting `resolve` to the searched foreground and re-running, which fails
# the two glyph assertions below.
#
# What it asserts:
#
#   1. The lit close slab fills RED (not a shaded chrome grey).
#   2. Its glyph paints LIGHTER than that fill - a white X antialiases to
#      pinks, so every glyph pixel is brighter than the red under it.
#   3. NO part of the glyph is darker than the fill. That is the half that
#      catches the defect: a black X is the mirror image of a white one and
#      "there is a glyph here" cannot tell them apart.
#
# LIMIT, stated rather than glossed: the lit state is driven by a PRESS
# (WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN/HTCLOSE), not by a hover. `paintCaptionSlab` paints the
# same red fill and the same `on_danger` glyph for both - press only firms the
# red by the shared delta - and a synthesized WM_NCMOUSEMOVE cannot be captured
# here: TrackMouseEvent watches the REAL cursor, so on a background desktop the
# WM_NCMOUSELEAVE lands within a frame and clears the hover before PrintWindow
# runs (T233's lesson). A press LATCHES on purpose and survives the capture.
#
# Runs on the background test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so it
# never takes the user's foreground. Only touches ghoztty processes running
# from this repo's zig-out.
