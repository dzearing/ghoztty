# Machine-chooser CLOSE-CHORD acceptance (tracker T603).
#
# Upstream `11fe14bc3` fixed the Mac half: "Close" (Cmd-W) sends its action to
# the FIRST RESPONDER, nothing in the chooser panel's chain answered it, and
# AppKit carried the search on into the MAIN window - so a chord aimed at the
# dialog closed a pane behind it. This is the Windows seat's regression arm for
# the same promise, in the two halves a user would describe:
#
#   1. Ctrl+W with the chooser focused DISMISSES THE CHOOSER. (Before T603 it
#      did nothing at all here: `MachineChooser.handleKey` had no case for it,
#      so the key fell through to the filter EDIT, which ignores it.)
#   2. Every terminal window and pane behind the chooser is still there
#      afterwards. This is the half the Mac bug broke, and win32 has never been
#      able to reach it - the chord arrives as a WM_KEYDOWN at a chooser
#      control, and only a Surface's own WndProc turns a key into a binding.
#      Asserted anyway, and MORE worth asserting since T712 made the picker
#      modeless: the window behind it is now live rather than disabled, so the
#      one structural reason a stray chord could not reach a pane is gone. The
#      failure mode is expensive (a pane full of work, closed by a chord aimed
#      somewhere else) and cheap to keep watched.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL, mandatory and first: the same chord, delivered the same
# way, closes a pane when a TERMINAL is focused. Without it "the pane behind
# survived" is equally consistent with the keystroke never arriving - which is
# exactly how a confident, wrong negative gets recorded.
#
# THE CONTROL HAS A PRECONDITION OF ITS OWN (T1284). Ctrl+W over a terminal
# closes the pane only when that pane's shell is descendant-free; a busy shell
# gets `Surface.close`'s confirmation dialog instead (T41), which is MODAL. On
# 2026-09-02 this script scored three reds inside the suite and ALL PASS on the
# re-run alone, and the filed suspicion was that a posted chord cannot reach a
# background desktop. It can: the reproduction is a forced confirmation
# (`--confirm-close-surface=always`), which produces that suite log assertion
# for assertion - the pane count frozen at 2, the chooser still opening because
# a posted message ignores the modal's EnableWindow, and the owner window never
# re-enabling. So the control now WAITS for the shells to go idle, and reads
# the dialog back rather than inferring a missing keystroke from a pane that
# did not close. Harness defect, not a desktop capability gap.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts assertion (1) to expect the chooser to SURVIVE
# Ctrl+W, which is the pre-T603 behavior and MUST fail; it is how a run proves
# this script discriminates rather than riding a green desktop.
#
# -ForceConfirm reproduces the 2026-09-02 suite red on demand (see T1284): it
# runs the app with `confirm-close-surface = always`, so the positive control's
# Ctrl+W raises the modal instead of closing. It MUST fail, at the dialog
# assertion and the pane count, and it must fail THERE ONLY - that is the
# demonstration that the dialog is now named and dismissed rather than left
# standing to redden two more sections.
