# Activity Monitor SELECTION TREATMENT acceptance (T1008).
#
# The user reported the machine chooser's selected row as "a bright purple pill
# with a thick purple outline" beside a screenshot of Windows 11 Settings, whose
# lists mark selection with a quiet neutral fill and a small accent bar at the
# leading edge. T828 fixed it on the chooser and left the Activity Monitor's
# process table - the same kind of surface, a list of selectable rows - painting
# the treatment that was reported: the panel dragged 45 percent toward the accent
# under an accent focus ring. This script asserts the process table now paints
# what the chooser does, out of the same module (`list_selection.zig`).
#
# The unit tests assert the model; this asserts the PIXELS, for the reason
# `chooser-selection.ps1` does: every colour in the old treatment cleared its
# contrast floor and the model tests were green while the panel looked like that.
# What is measured here:
#
#   B. with the row selected and the caret moved off the table, the row carries
#      the DERIVED unemphasized wash of the panel (ColorMath's `Get-Wash`, the
#      same function the Zig side spells `color_math.wash`), its mark is NEUTRAL,
#      and the row has NO outline - every line across it is the fill itself;
#   C. driving the table moves it to the emphasized wash and turns the mark into
#      the user's accent, which clears the 3:1 chrome floor against the fill it
#      sits on and is a narrow BAR, not a stripe down the whole row;
#   D. the accent appears EXACTLY ONCE on that row: the caret rim the table draws
#      over it is neutral ink, not a second accent mark. D is the assertion that
#      would have caught the reported defect.
#
# PINNING THE FOCUS STATE (T988's rule). Which weight the fill carries and
# whether a rim is drawn are both functions of "does the table hold the
# keyboard", so a section that does not say which state it measures is red or
# green by luck. The panel has no `UISF_HIDEFOCUS` equivalent to post at it - its
# table is an owner-drawn region rather than a control, and teaching it Windows'
# focus-visual bit is T1009 - so the state is pinned the way the panel itself
# defines it: B clicks the filter field (the panel loses the keyboard, so the
# table is unemphasized and draws no rim) and C clicks the row (the panel takes
# it back and the table is the focused region). Each section asserts the state it
# claims, from the row's own paint, before it measures anything else.
#
# THE ORACLE reads the row one LINE at a time - the modal colour of a horizontal
# strip - and never scans for "coloured pixels": cell text is drawn with subpixel
# antialiasing whose fringes are as saturated as any accent, so a chroma scan
# over a row would be scoring the font renderer. A modal per line answers what
# the line IS (the fill, or an outline drawn across the whole row), which is what
# every claim here is about; the mark is read from its own column, which sits
# inside the first cell's padding where no glyph can reach.
