# Hero-mode TRUE-port oracle (T58 design / T59a acceptance; supersedes the
# T19 static-stand-in oracle).
#
# Drives REAL key chords into the debug build and asserts the T58 layout.
# PHASE 1 (2 panes - both tiles fit on-screen): snapshot pipeline oracle:
#   with a busy loop running in the HIDDEN pane, the debug log shows
#   "hero snap committed" lines and the owner-painted carousel region's
#   pixels CHANGE between shots (thumbnails refreshing from hidden-pane
#   renderer captures).
# PHASE 2 (3 panes): layout + interaction:
#   1. ctrl+shift+space: exactly ONE visible pane (the hero) at ~75%
#      width / full height on the left; every OTHER leaf HIDDEN
#      (IsWindowVisible false) and sized EXACTLY like the hero rect (T58:
#      all leaves stay hero-sized so selection swaps need no reflow); the
#      carousel column contains NO child HWNDs (it is owner-painted).
#   2. ctrl+alt+down moves the selection: a different leaf becomes the
#      single visible pane, at the same hero rect.
#   3. Click a carousel tile: selects that leaf (mouse-up inside tile).
#   3b. ctrl+shift+down/up ALSO navigates (T61: swap_split is intercepted
#       in hero mode instead of silently swapping the hidden tree).
#   4. ctrl+shift+space again restores the exact tree geometry.
#   5. Palette path (T57): ctrl+shift+p -> "hero" -> Enter produces the
#      same hero layout.
# PHASE 3 (T59b - interactions & motion):
#   6. Click-swap ANIMATES: mid-slide every hero HWND is hidden (the
#      region owner-paints sliding snapshots); skipped when the OS
#      reduced-motion setting disables client-area animations.
#   7. Hover + wheel reach the carousel (debug-log oracles); with 5 tiles
#      the strip overflows and the wheel offset is nonzero.
#   8. The divider MARK is design-system compliant (T250): bandPx wide (the
#      same 2 DIP as a split divider), painted with the run's
#      `split-divider-color`, and it changes color under the pointer.
#   9. Divider drag narrows the hero (all leaves re-sized to the new hero
#      rect); double-clicking the divider resets the ratio to 0.25.
#
# T218 batch 6: migrated onto the BACKGROUND test desktop
# (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so the run never takes the user's
# foreground - asserted here, not assumed.
#
# WHY THE CAROUSEL PIXEL ORACLE STILL WORKS AND THE PANE ONE DOES NOT. The
# harness's CAPTURE LIMIT is about the OpenGL terminal surface, which
# PrintWindow returns as a flat fill. The carousel is the other half: it has NO
# child HWNDs, HeroCarousel.paint draws it into the PARENT window's DC inside
# BeginPaint/EndPaint, and every thumbnail refresh goes through InvalidateRect
# (Window.zig, WM_APP_HERO_SNAP) - so what the capture reads is a repaint from
# current state rather than whatever was last drawn there. (This used to say
# "unlike a GetDC paint", citing T233. T252 re-measured that: a GetDC paint IS
# visible to PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT); what it is not is reproducible,
# which is the actual rule - win32-design-system.md 5b.) The thumbnails themselves are
# renderer output: the pane's own renderer thread captures its GL content into
# a DIB (Surface.heroSnap*) and the GUI thread blits it with GDI. So a changing
# carousel is direct evidence that the hidden panes are really rendering.
#
# WHAT T214 DROPPED HERE, AND WHAT BROUGHT IT BACK. The two
# `Get-PaneColorCount` probes that PrintWindow'd a GhozttyTerminal child and
# required >= 8 distinct colors ("hero pane renders content") were dropped
# rather than weakened: that probe reads the flat fill and would score green
# against a pane that renders nothing, exactly the trap the harness header
# warns about. T275 built the fifth route T214 named - the app handing out its
# OWN renderer's pixels through the debug-only `capture-pane` IPC action, which
# is the same readback these very thumbnails come from - so both probes are
# back in phase 1, asserted on the pane's real glass and on the HIDDEN pane
# specifically. The carousel signature stays: it is the same claim measured on
# the GDI side of the boundary, and two independent oracles for hero mode's
# central promise is not one too many.
#
# A positive control (ctrl+k, T55) runs first so an injection failure is
# distinguishable from a hero regression. Only touches ghoztty processes
# running from this repo's zig-out*.
#
# -NegativeControl flips the toggle-off claim to "the tree came back MUTATED",
# which MUST fail: that geometry is only restored intact after the whole phase-2
# chain (toggle on -> nav -> tile click -> ctrl+shift nav -> toggle off) ran,
# and it is also T61's no-tree-mutation oracle.
#
# WHERE THE SCREENSHOTS GO, AND WHAT THE COMMITTED ONE IS FOR (T1128). This script used to
# end by writing `artifacts\hero-mode-t59b.png` unconditionally - a TRACKED
# path - so every ordinary run left the working tree dirty. The go-loop reads a
# dirty tree at claim time as stranded work from a dead turn, so a routine
# acceptance run manufactured a false report for the next one, and 13 commits
# of that file are accidents rather than decisions.
#
# That artifact is DOCUMENTATION, not a reference: T59b.md and
# windows-parity-details.md cite it as the screenshot of the layout this script
# proves. It is not compared against, and it cannot be: since the migration to
# the background test desktop the hero pane's terminal glass comes back as a
# flat fill (the CAPTURE LIMIT above), so a pixel diff against a committed
# picture would be permanently red for the desktop rather than for the app.
# Deleting it instead would break two live citations.
#
# So: every run writes its shots to -ShotDir ($TEMP by default), and only
# -UpdateBaseline refreshes the committed copy. What replaces the missing
# comparison is a floor - Get-TestCaptureContent scores each shot, and a
# capture that has collapsed to near-uniform FAILS the run instead of being
# saved silently, which is the check the 133921 -> 41165 byte drop went past.
#
# -ExePath: test a different build. Release builds emit no debug log, so
# log-based assertions auto-skip (geometry is the verdict).
#
# -ShotDir: where the window shots this run takes are written (default $TEMP).
# -UpdateBaseline: ALSO refresh the committed screenshot in artifacts\. Nothing
# in git is written without it - see WHERE THE SCREENSHOTS GO above.
