# parity-tasks seat acceptance (tracker T344): the loop's task selector must
# never hand this box a task only the other seat can do, and must never hide
# one silently.
#
# Sections:
#   A. Back-compat: a task file with no `seat:` field is `win`, and `next`
#      returns it. (Every pre-T344 file is in this shape.)
#   B. `next` skips a `mac` todo, returns the next eligible one, and NAMES what
#      it skipped and why.
#   C. `next -Seat mac` returns that same mac task - the other seat has a queue,
#      the task did not disappear.
#   D. `any` is returned to BOTH seats.
#   E. No ready task for this seat => exit 1, and the output still lists the
#      other seat's todos.
#   F. `list` shows every seat by default; `-Seat` filters it.
#   G. `validate` rejects a seat outside the set (a typo would hide a task from
#      every seat) and passes a good one.
#   H. `new -Seat mac` writes the field; `new` without it writes `win`.
#   I. Against the REAL tracker: `validate` ALL PASS, and `next` no longer
#      returns a Mac-seat task.
#   J. `next` orders by PRIORITY before id, and an untriaged task loses to a
#      deliberate P2. `set-priority` writes the field and the reason.
#   K. PRIORITY outranks `order:` (D55, user 2026-08-12). An unplaced P0 beats
#      every positioned lower-priority task - the 2026-08-11 incident, where
#      three hand-reported P0s carrying no `order:` ranked MaxValue and sat
#      behind ~200 positioned P2s for a day. `order:` still sequences INSIDE a
#      band: a decimal injects between two same-priority neighbours without
#      renumbering, and an unparseable order reads as absent rather than as 0.
#   K2. Triage can re-prioritise and that alone moves the queue head, with no
#      renumbering. `set-priority` journals the transition (naming the old
#      priority and the reason), writes `triage-reason:`, stays silent on a
#      no-op, and honours `-NoNote` for a bulk pass.
#   K3. The loop's own follow-ups (T345). Every turn files what it turned up, so
#      a follow-up always carries a HIGHER id than the task that produced it.
#      Inside one band the older id still goes first (equal worth is FIFO), and
#      a re-triage alone lifts a 1011-id-younger follow-up to the head with no
#      renumbering. Plus the P3 band: "reviewed and deliberately last" outranks
#      "nobody has looked yet", and a band outside the set is a validate
#      FAILURE rather than the silent blanking that hid `P3` in two real files.
#   L. `next -Claim` marks the picked task in-progress in the same breath;
#      plain `next` stays a read-only question.
#   M. Stale in-progress resume (2026-08-05): one agent runs the queue, so a
#      task still in-progress when `next -Claim` runs is a stale claim and is
#      handed BACK (RESUME:) instead of new work; plain `next` only reports it
#      (IN FLIGHT:). `note` appends timestamped progress-log entries; a claim
#      seeds the log; `new -Tags` writes tags and validate rejects a bogus one;
#      an in-progress task with no progress log fails validate.
#   N. Status journaling (T564): every `set-status` appends the transition to
#      the task's own progress log, preserving the OLD status verbatim - which
#      is the only place a discarded `blocked(reason)` survives. `-SourceNote`
#      names who asked, a no-op writes nothing, and `-NoNote` is the bulk
#      escape hatch.
#   O. The same, end to end through the dashboard: a POST to `/api/status`
#      carrying the button's own label lands in the file as
#      "(by dashboard: <label>)". Runs a private node server on port 7913 with
#      GHOZTTY_TASK_DIR pointed at the fixture, so the real tracker and the
#      real dashboard on 7788 are never touched. Skipped if node is absent.
#   P. Un-blocking needs evidence (T892): moving a task OUT of `blocked(...)`
#      is refused without `-SourceNote`, restates the task's `unblock:`
#      condition both in the refusal and on the way through, and leaves the
#      file untouched when it refuses. `-NoNote` keeps the bulk pass and says
#      it took it. Every other transition - claim, close, re-park - is
#      unchanged.
#   Q. "Is this task still true?" (T404). A todo is a claim about the code made
#      on the day it was filed and nothing re-checks it, so `next` names the
#      filing date and any commits that have touched the files the task itself
#      names since, and `stale-scan` ranks the whole queue by the same
#      question - a later commit NAMING the task first, then oldest. Runs in a
#      throwaway git repo, because the signal is a question about history. A
#      task naming only a directory must not count (ranked by raw hit count the
#      first cut put every task naming `test\win32` on top), and outside a repo
#      the whole signal degrades to silence rather than guessing.
#   R. `set-tags` (T503). Tags arrived on `new` alone, so an already-filed task
#      could only be categorised by hand-editing frontmatter and the backlog
#      carried none - invisible to the dashboard's category filter. The verb
#      writes the field where `new` puts it, replaces by default so a
#      correction can remove a tag, unions under `-Add`, refuses an
#      out-of-vocabulary tag and an empty set without touching the file, and
#      the section closes by asserting the REAL tracker has no open task
#      without a category.
#   S. Duplicate detection (T651). The same defect was filed three times in two
#      days because `new` looked nothing up. Filing a near-duplicate title now
#      NAMES the existing task and files anyway (a refusal would lose work); a
#      title sharing only the backlog's common words stays silent, which is the
#      whole reason the match is idf-weighted rather than raw overlap; `similar`
#      asks the question without writing a file; and the closing check runs the
#      real 1400-title tracker.
