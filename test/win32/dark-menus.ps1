# T79 acceptance: context menus (TrackPopupMenuEx) must match the app
# theme. Pre-fix, both the terminal surface menu and the tab-bar menu drew
# with the classic LIGHT menu palette even on dark chrome.
#
# The fix routes `window-theme` through the undocumented uxtheme ordinals
# (SetPreferredAppMode #135 + FlushMenuThemes #136) at app init / config
# reload / WM_SETTINGCHANGE.
#
# Two GUI launches assert both directions:
#   run 1: --window-theme=dark  -> both menus render DARK  (avg lum < 90)
#   run 2: --window-theme=light -> both menus render LIGHT (avg lum > 160)
#
# Menus are found as visible '#32768' (menu-class) windows in the GUI's pid,
# opened by right-clicks - the surface menu via a click in the pane, the
# tab-bar menu via a click in the tab strip (window-show-tab-bar=always keeps
# it visible with one tab). The menu window is captured and its interior
# averaged. A menu that never appears is a SETUP FAIL (injection broken), not
# a theme verdict.
#
# T216: migrated onto the BACKGROUND test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1),
# so it never takes the user's foreground - asserted here, not assumed. This is
# the worked example for the mouse half of the migration, and it settled the
# two questions T212 could not answer from the keyboard spike:
#
#   * TrackPopupMenuEx DOES run on a background desktop. The menu appears,
#     paints, and dismisses on a posted Escape.
#   * PrintWindow reads a '#32768' menu with real content - menus are
#     GDI-painted chrome, which is exactly the half of the CAPTURE LIMIT that
#     survives (the OpenGL terminal surface is the half that does not).
#
# Clicks are POSTED (SendInput is refused off the input desktop), so they must
# name the window that would really have received them: the pane child for the
# surface menu, the top-level window for the tab strip. Menu keys go through
# Send-TestControlKey, which posts without touching focus - Send-TestKeys would
# SetFocus first and dismiss the menu it was meant to drive.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts run 1's expectation and MUST fail; it is how a run
# proves the brightness assertions still discriminate.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
