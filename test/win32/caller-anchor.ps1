# T1079 acceptance: a `+split`/`+rearrange` with no explicit anchor lands at the
# pane it was invoked FROM, not at whatever window is focused when the app gets
# around to the message.
#
# THE DEFECT. The default anchor used to be resolved on the app's side at HANDLE
# time (`frontWindow`), which is racy by construction: an agent in window A asks
# for a side pane, the user clicks window B in the meantime, and the pane opens
# in B. The race does not need a user either - an agent's command is asynchronous
# with respect to focus even when nobody touches anything.
#
# The CLI half already shipped here: `apprt.ipc.seedCallerPane` inserts
# `--caller-pane=$GHOZTTY_PANE_ID` ahead of anything from `-e` on, for both
# `+split` and `+rearrange`. The APP half was macOS-only, and the win32 server's
# argument parser ignores what it does not recognize ON PURPOSE (the app<->CLI
# compatibility contract), so the flag was silently dropped and Windows kept the
# old focused-window fallback. T1079 gives the win32 server its own
# `callerAnchorPane`.
#
# HOW THE RACE IS DRIVEN WITHOUT A USER: window B is created SECOND, so it is
# the app's front window (foreground on the interactive desktop; the most
# recently created window under `frontWindow`'s fallback on a background one) for
# the whole run - splitting a pane never raises its window. Section B proves that
# rather than assuming it: with nothing forwarded, a `+split` lands in B. Every
# later section then sets `$GHOZTTY_PANE_ID` to a pane in window A and asks where
# the pane went.
#
#   * broken: every section lands in B - the flag is dropped and the fallback
#     answers every time.
#   * fixed:  C and H land in A (the caller's window), while B, D, E and F still
#     land in B - explicit targeting and the no-caller fallback are untouched.
#
# The precedence table itself (explicit target/pane/from-focused wins, absent or
# empty changes nothing, an unresolvable caller pane FALLS BACK while an explicit
# `--pane=` naming nothing stays a hard error) is unit tested in both zig lanes -
# `apprt.ipc.args.callerAnchorPane`. This script is the end-to-end half: it is
# the only thing that proves the flag survives the CLI, the wire and the server's
# parser and reaches the window that opens.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA and a private IPC endpoint suffix, and it
# only ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched from this repo's
# zig-out. Runs on a BACKGROUND desktop (T217) so the fixture windows never steal
# the user's foreground. Session persistence is OFF - the anchoring question is
# about windows, and plain ConPTY panes make the run fast and agent-free.
