# The end-of-day publish decides correctly, and refuses to publish when it
# cannot (T1220).
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. Since decision D85 the ONLY way this repo's work reaches the
# user's terminal is a published win-v release, and `scripts\daily-publish.ps1`
# is what makes that happen without anybody typing a command. Three things about
# it are silent when they rot:
#
#   - the DUE decision. Too eager and the loop spends its evening running
#     ten-minute ReleaseFast builds; too shy and the day's fixes never ship, and
#     the only symptom is a user who says "still broken" about a fix that landed
#     yesterday - which is exactly the failure T525 was filed for.
#   - the VERSION scheme. A version that collides with an existing release
#     fails loudly, but a version that quietly walks the wrong axis (squatting
#     on a Mac minor the Mac seat has not released) shows up weeks later.
#   - the SKIP paths. Docker down and `gh` unauthenticated must be skips with a
#     named reason that leave the watermark alone, never failures that stall the
#     turn and never silent no-ops.
#
# The old `morning-refresh.ps1` had a harness that covered exactly these three
# shapes for the swap it drove; it was retired with the swap (T1218). This is
# what covers the publish that replaced it.
#
# Sections:
#
#   A  the due decision, all arms, with no clock and no watermark file.
#   B  the version scheme, over injected release-tag sets.
#   C  the preconditions, each one named in the reason when it is missing.
#   D  the watermark reader: this script's JSON, the older bare date, garbage.
#   E  live -Check: decides out loud, stamps nothing, publishes nothing.
#   F  live SKIP paths: Docker down no longer stops the default publish (the
#      whole of T1292), and under -Local it is still a skip with the reason
#      named, exit 0, watermark untouched, publish script never invoked.
#   G  live -NoPublish: stamps the day and reports the tag it would publish.
#   H  a real publish run stamps `tagged`, not `published`: CI has not built the
#      tag yet, and claiming otherwise is what hid a three-day outage.
#   I  the tag publisher's refusals (bad version, a version already tagged) and
#      its dry-run happy path.
#   J  the on-demand request (T1294): it gets through the one-per-day rule, and
#      nothing else does.
#   K  the request reader, including the shapes that must NOT read as a request.
#   L  the 2026-09-03 shape end to end: publish at T, fix at T+90m, shipped the
#      same day - and the ordinary cadence unchanged around it.
#   M  -Status: what shipped, and what has landed since.
#   P  the stranded threshold (T1588), both sides of it, pure.
#   Q  the stranded threshold end to end: under it nothing moves; at it the
#      request is filed and honoured through the ordinary request path.
#
# Hermetic: a sandbox watermark under %TEMP%, a fake `docker`/`gh` on PATH, and
# a sentinel publish script that records if it was ever run. No Docker, no
# network, no build, nothing published.
