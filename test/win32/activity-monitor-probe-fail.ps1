# T298 acceptance: what a per-card metrics PROBE does when the machine is not
# there.
#
# `activity-monitor-remote.ps1` section H covers the happy half - an inactive
# card carrying live uptime/CPU/mem from its own dialed connection. It cannot
# cover this half, and the reason is worth stating: there, a machine has a card
# only because a WINDOW is connected to it, so every card in that fixture is by
# construction reachable. A second loopback agent would give it an unreachable
# one, except `--listen` takes the single-instance guard
# (`src/remote/agent/single_instance.zig`) and the second agent exits 183
# before it ever binds.
#
# So this script fakes the OTHER source of cards: the relay DIRECTORY. A
# loopback HTTP listener answers `/v1/client/devices` with one device that has
# never existed, and refuses the `/v1/client/connect` WebSocket upgrade that a
# probe dial would need. The same fake-directory harness
# `ipc-machine-chooser.ps1` uses, pointed at the Activity Monitor.
#
# What it asserts:
#
#   A. the panel's carousel gains a card for the directory's machine, and the
#      panel PROBES it - a directory entry is not just a label;
#   B. a dial the machine refuses paints `unreachable` on that card. This is
#      the assertion that fails if a failed probe leaves the card sitting on
#      "connecting" forever, or worse keeps painting the directory's stale
#      `online: true`;
#   C. it is NOT re-dialed inside its backoff. The panel ticks every 1.5s and
#      the backoff floor is 30s, so a 20-second watch that sees the dial count
#      move means the probe is looping - which against a real relay would be
#      ~13 dials a minute per dead machine, forever, for as long as the panel
#      is open;
#   D. and the panel stays alive and keeps sampling its own source throughout -
#      an unreachable card must not take the panel down with it.
#
# ORACLE. Cards are GDI-painted strings with no control to query, so the oracle
# is the panel's own `carousel ... states=` line (T298), which reports each
# card's summary - the struct the painter formats, not a restatement of the
# claim - alongside the `probing machine=` / `probe connected` dial log.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop and asserts at the end that it
# never took the user's foreground.
