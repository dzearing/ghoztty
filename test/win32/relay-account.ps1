# Relay account acceptance (T21a store, T93 brokered model, T141 GUI move).
# Renamed from ipc-relay-login.ps1: there is no +relay-login verb any more.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\relay-account.ps1
#
# T141 moved sign-in/sign-out out of the CLI and into the machine chooser's
# account row (the Mac has never had a CLI verb for it). So this script proves:
#
#   1. the CLI verbs are GONE - +relay-login / +relay-logout are rejected and
#      no longer appear in +help. This is the deliverable, so it is asserted
#      first and it is a hard failure, not a warning.
#   2. GUI sign-in end to end: ctrl+shift+n opens the chooser, its account
#      button reads "Sign in with Google...", clicking it starts the brokered
#      flow (PKCE + loopback), the harness plays the browser, the code is
#      exchanged at the RELAY, a DPAPI account.dat appears, and the row flips
#      to the signed-in email + "Sign Out" WITHOUT reopening the chooser.
#   3. GUI sign-out on the same row: POST /oauth/signout with the session
#      bearer, account.dat removed, button back to "Sign in with Google...".
#   4. sign-in against a dead relay: the flow fails, the chooser stays up and
#      says so, and no account is written.
#   5. legacy pre-T93 store: the GUI account tier treats it as signed out, and
#      says so WITHOUT naming a CLI verb.
#   6. renew + rotation: a near-expiry stored session is renewed at the STORED
#      relay (Bearer = old token) and the rotated token is persisted.
#   7. account tier E2E: with a fresh session, +new-remote-window WITHOUT
#      --token dials a live relay+agent (needs go + ghoztty-agent).
#   7b. T713: signing out CLOSES that account-backed window, leaves a local
#      window untouched, and refuses a fresh relay dial until sign-in. Runs
#      inside 7's live relay+agent, which is the only environment on this box
#      where an account-backed window can exist at all. What it deliberately
#      does NOT assert - that the far session kept running - is explained at
#      the assertion site (T1554).
#   8. a build with NO Google client id - which is what SHIPS - offers no
#      sign-in button at all, says so in the row, and puts the remedy in the
#      hint (T747). Sections 2-4 all set GHOSTTY_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, which is how
#      a dead button shipped past a green suite; this one launches with
#      GHOZTTY_RELAY_NO_CLIENT_ID instead, so it measures the shipped state on
#      any seat - configured or not (T918) - and ends with the configured
#      relaunch as its control.
#
# Sections 5-7 SEED the account store directly (a DPAPI blob in the current
# shape) instead of re-driving the GUI: what they exercise is the reader/renew
# tier, and keeping the chord grabs to sections 2-4 keeps the script fast and
# deterministic.
#
# T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so
# it never takes the user's foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed. The
# private win32 driver (AcctDrv) this script used to carry is gone. Three notes
# on what the migration changed beyond the mechanics:
#
#   * the chooser sections no longer SKIP. They used to bail out whenever the
#     foreground grab lost its race ("those sections need the foreground; they
#     SKIP, never fail"), which quietly took the whole GUI half of this script
#     out of a run. On the test desktop the chord always lands, so a chooser
#     that does not open is now a hard SETUP FAIL.
#   * the account button is still activated with Send-TestControlClick
#     (BM_CLICK) rather than a synthetic mouse click, for the original reason:
#     it keeps the assertions about the ROW - its label flipping, its enabled
#     state - independent of whether a click landed on the right pixel.
#   * sections 5-7 used to let `+new-window` AUTO-SPAWN the GUI, which puts a
#     window on the user's desktop. They launch it on the test desktop now.
#
# T171 hardened three things after one unreproducible failure whose text was
# lost - a run that produced 30 assertions out of a full 53 and then simply
# stopped, with no SKIP line to explain it:
#
#   * PORTS ARE PER-RUN, not fixed numbers. Each fake relay (and the live relay
#     in section 7) gets a port the OS just handed out, and the port is asserted
#     FREE immediately before it is bound.
#   * A fake relay is up when it ANSWERS ITS OWN NONCE, not when a TCP connect
#     succeeds. A connect also succeeds against a dying listener from the
#     previous run and against any unrelated process holding the port.
#   * A TERMINATING error is an assertion failure with its message and line,
#     not a silent end of run - and a failing run KEEPS its temp directory
#     (both GUIs' stderr, every CLI's stdout, both hit logs) and prints the
#     path. Losing that evidence is what made the original failure a mystery.
#
# Self-contained and non-interactive. A raw-TCP "fake relay" serves the
# brokered endpoints (POST /oauth/exchange | /oauth/renew | /oauth/signout) and
# logs every hit; the account store is redirected to a temp path
# (GHOSTTY_ACCOUNT_STORE) so the box's real account is never touched. Only ever
# touches ghoztty processes running from the repo zig-out.
