# remote-test-client on-demand build acceptance (tracker T359): the acceptance
# scripts that drive a real agent produce their own client binary, so a tree
# that has only ever run `zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32` still runs them.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS COVERS
#
# `remote-test-client` is an on-demand build target - `build.zig` gives it its
# own `zig build remote-test-client` step and nothing the default install step
# builds reaches it. Six acceptance scripts need it (it is the only thing here
# that speaks the agent protocol without a GUI) and every one of them opened by
# asserting the file exists. On a clean tree that reads as `FAIL
# remote-test-client exists`, which looks like the agent failed to build rather
# than "this binary was never asked for" - and two of the six exit 1 on the
# spot, so their remaining assertions never run.
#
# lib\TestClient.ps1 is the fix: resolve, and build it if it is missing.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\test-client-build.ps1
#
# Sections: A the helper's contract, B the fast path never shells out to zig,
# C -NoBuild reports instead of building, D the real repair (the client is
# deleted and the helper puts it back), E every consumer is wired to it.
#
# Hermetic: launches no ghoztty and no agent, and the only file it touches
# outside its temp dir is zig-out\bin\remote-test-client.exe - which section D
# moves aside and restores if the rebuild fails.
