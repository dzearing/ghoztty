# T305 acceptance: the win32 chrome takes its colors from `chrome_theme`, and
# they TRACK the two inputs that own them - the chrome background and the
# user's accent.
#
# Two claims, two oracles, because they fail in different ways:
#
#   A. THE BAND FOLLOWS THE BACKGROUND'S LUMINANCE. The caption band used to be
#      `background + 20` per channel. On a light background a per-channel add
#      clamps toward white, so the band, its hover and the text all converge on
#      the same near-white and the fixed `RGB(230,230,230)` title goes
#      illegible. The wash reverses direction instead. Three runs - `#f3f3f3`,
#      `#ffffff` (T274's own named failure, where a per-channel add cannot move
#      at all) and `#1e1e1e` - and the band is measured against the
#      value `color_math.wash(bg, chrome_theme.bar_wash)` DERIVES - recomputed
#      here rather than pasted, so a change to `bar_wash` moves the app and the
#      oracle together (the T257 rule).
#
#   B. THE ACCENT IS THE USER'S. The chooser and the Activity Monitor each held
#      an invented blue (`#3D8EF8` and `RGB(80,160,235)`); neither was the
#      color anybody picked. The panel's ACTIVE machine card is outlined in the
#      accent, so the oracle is an exact-RGB scan of the panel capture: the
#      accent is set to one value, captured, set to a second, captured, and the
#      painted pixel must have MOVED to the new one. A test that matched
#      whatever this box is already set to would prove nothing (the T174 rule).
#      Both probe accents are chosen to clear the 3:1 chrome floor against the
#      card unassisted, so `chrome_theme.accentOn` returns them untouched and
#      the expected pixel is the literal accent.
#
#      B also covers the CACHE and its invalidation, which is the half a
#      relaunch cannot see: the registry is changed with no notification and
#      the panel must still paint the OLD accent (the cache is real), and then
#      `WM_DWMCOLORIZATIONCOLORCHANGED` is posted to the top-level window and
#      the next panel must paint the NEW one (the invalidation is wired).
#
#      Two cases, and NEITHER of them is the live-update claim. B3 closes and
#      reopens the panel around the message, so it scores the CACHE DROP only -
#      a panel that repaints because it was freshly constructed passes it, and
#      that close/reopen was the workaround standing in for the missing
#      repaint. B4 leaves the panel OPEN across the notification instead, which
#      is closer to what a user with the panel on screen does, and it scores
#      one more thing: that an open panel keeps no accent of its own. It still
#      cannot see whether anybody INVALIDATED that panel, because photographing
#      it repaints it (T585/T1405). Section G scores that, and by counting
#      paints rather than reading pixels.
#
#   C. THE DEBUG BUILD MARKS ITSELF (T43), and the release build does not.
#      A Debug/ReleaseSafe build drags the chrome background toward warning
#      amber before anything is derived from it, so the whole band is amber and
#      the window cannot be mistaken for the installed release; the taskbar half
#      is the " [DEBUG]" title suffix. Scored inside A rather than as its own
#      section, because A already measures the exact surface the marker changes
#      and a second copy of that machinery is what T257 spent a task deleting.
#      Both assertions are two-directional - `+version`'s own "build mode" line
#      says which build this is, and the expectation flips with it, so "release
#      build unaffected" is a real check rather than an untested half. That also
#      defuses T350 here: a non-Debug zig-out changes the expected pixel, and
#      this script would notice rather than fail mysteriously.
#
#   D. THE PANELS FOLLOW THE SAME SURFACE (T308). A. covers the chrome band;
#      the Activity Monitor and the machine chooser had their own ~35 hardcoded
#      constants and opened dark on a light theme. Scored on the panel's own
#      fill against an EXACT expectation - a panel paints from
#      `chrome_theme.chromeBase`, which under the default `window-theme = auto`
#      is `--background` itself, so the mode pixel must BE the background. One
#      assertion, three claims: the panel tracks the theme, it does not wash
#      (unlike the band, a panel abuts nothing), and it is not debug-tinted.
#      Its text is then scored by EXACT presence of the derived ramp color,
#      not by A's luminance-extreme oracle: a panel is full of controls, and
#      both probe backgrounds turn up a pure black/white pixel somewhere that
#      clears any floor by itself, so the extreme would pass without ever
#      touching our text.
#
#   F. THE CHILD WINDOWS FOLLOW THE ACCENT TOO (T307's child half, T585). The
#      surface is the viewer's contents card (`GhozttyViewerTOC`), a real child
#      HWND whose ACTIVE row is filled with the RAW accent - the only unmixed
#      accent pixel the card paints, so an exact-RGB hit is that pill and
#      nothing else. The card is put in its GUTTER layout (a viewer pane wider
#      than `viewer_toc_layout.gutter_min_dip`, which is why the window is
#      resized), where it is always visible instead of being an overlay a click
#      has to open.
#
#      Scoring the pill at all needed T215: the fill is gated on
#      `isEmphasized()`, which was a bare `GetForegroundWindow` comparison, and
#      that is null for EVERY window on a background desktop - so the pill was
#      the unemphasized gray here forever, which is what T585 was filed about.
#      It now reads `w32.windowIsActive`, whose off-input-desktop proxy is the
#      queue-scoped `GetActiveWindow`, and the harness can set that
#      (`Set-TestActiveWindow`, T568). F asserts that activation rather than
#      assuming it.
#
#      F3 is a SOURCE assertion, and the paragraph below is why.
#
# WHAT NO CAPTURE IN THIS SCRIPT CAN CLAIM: that anything INVALIDATED a window
# (T585). Measured, not reasoned - `repaintForColorChange` was cut down to a
# bare cache drop, with no `RedrawWindow` at all, and this script still passed
# 129 of 129, B4 included. The reason is that photographing a window makes it
# paint: `-Sync` is `WM_PRINTCLIENT`, the async path is
# `PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)`, and both hand the window a DC and ask
# for a frame. The frame it draws reads the accent through the cache the
# message just dropped, so the new color appears whether or not anybody
# invalidated anything.
#
# So every PIXEL claim about the accent here - B3, B4, F1, F2 - scores the
# CACHE and its drop, and no capture will ever score more than that.
#
#   G. THE REPAINT ITSELF (T1405), which is therefore scored by COUNTING
#      PAINTS instead of reading pixels. The app counts its own WM_PAINT
#      cycles (`src/apprt/win32/paint_probe.zig`) and prints one line per
#      paint under GHOZTTY_PAINT_PROBE; WM_PRINTCLIENT deliberately does not
#      count, so the camera cannot advance the counter it is being scored
#      against. The surface is the viewer's contents CARD, which repaints only
#      when invalidated, and only its OWNER is notified - so G goes red on a
#      build with no RedrawWindow, and red on one that drops RDW_ALLCHILDREN.
#      Both were run as negative controls before this section was believed
#      (T1133). G1 measures the card's quiet first, because a counter that
#      ticks on its own scores nothing.
#
# The candidate that failed for a related reason is written down so the next
# attempt does not re-derive it, and it is why G watches the card rather than
# the window: the hero carousel's accent-outlined selected tile measured PASS
# with the repaint reverted, because its thumbnail refresh timer repaints the
# band every 150ms unprompted - which would defeat a paint COUNTER on the
# top-level window just as thoroughly as it defeated a pixel oracle.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT CLAIM. T305's validation text asks for the
# ACTIVE-TAB INDICATOR to track the accent. There is no such pixel: the tab
# strip paints no accent at all - a tab's fill comes from `tab_shape.fillColor`
# (strip and content backgrounds), which is deliberate, matches WinUI's
# TabView, and is what T304's "the dark strip must not visibly move" note
# requires. The accent's real surfaces are the chooser row, this panel's card,
# and the carousel border, so the tracking claim is scored on one of those.
# Filed as the correction it is rather than fudged into a strip assertion.
#
# The band's TEXT is scored by extreme luminance (darkest pixel on a light
# band, lightest on a dark one) against the 4.5:1 floor. That direction is
# safe: ClearType fringing can only overshoot further from the band, never
# toward it, so a fringe cannot manufacture a pass. It says "the title is
# legible", not "the title is exactly `palette.text`" - the exact value is
# asserted in chrome_theme.zig's own sweep, in the none lane.
#
# SYSTEM STATE. Section B writes HKCU\...\DWM\AccentColor and restores it - the
# original value, or its ABSENCE - in a `finally`, so a mid-script failure
# cannot leave the box repainted (T179). The apps light/dark setting is NOT
# touched at all: section A varies `--background` instead, which reaches the
# same `chromeBase` input under the default `window-theme = auto` and leaves
# the user's Personalize key alone.
#
# CONTROLS. `-NegativeControl` inverts A's load-bearing direction claim - the
# light band is asserted to be LIGHTER than its background, which is exactly
# what `background + 20` produced - and that run MUST fail.
#
# T211/T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop. Every surface probed here is a
# native GDI-painted window, never the OpenGL terminal surface, so the T214
# capture limit does not apply.

    #   which was a bare `GetForegroundWindow` comparison and therefore always

    #   one.
    #
    #   F3, in SOURCE: the parent's redraw still carries `RDW_ALLCHILDREN`.
    #   That flag is what actually gets the new accent ON SCREEN in a child
    #   window without something else happening to repaint it, and no capture
    #   this harness can take will fail when it is removed - the capture is
    #   itself a repaint. So the flag is asserted where it can be: as text,
