# T1048 acceptance: in-place recovery pairs TABS by identity, not by position.
#
# THE DEFECT. `App.rebuildWindowInPlace` walked `for (0..tab_count) |ti|` and
# handed `captured.tabs[ti]` to live tab `ti`. That join is correct only while
# the window's tab list has not moved since `captureSessionLayout` ran - and the
# capture is immediately followed by `reconnectForRecovery`, which can block for
# SECONDS while it re-dials the agent. `LocalAgent.findOrSpawn` pumps IPC while
# it waits (T188), so a `ghoztty +close` issued in that window IS served: the tab
# list shifts under a capture nobody re-took, and every later tab is then rebuilt
# from its NEIGHBOUR's tree - its sessions re-ATTACHed into the wrong panes.
# `rebuildTabInPlace`'s correspondence check cannot catch it, because it compares
# node SHAPES and two single-pane tabs have the same shape. T343 removed exactly
# this class one level up (windows now pair on `layout_uuid`); T1048 gives tabs
# their own `uuid` and the same `pairTabs` join.
#
# HOW THE RACE IS DRIVEN, with no test hook and no debugger:
#
#   1. Three single-pane tabs, each with a DIFFERENT shell pid.
#   2. SUSPEND the agent. The app's transport FSM walks to `reconnecting` after
#      3 missed heartbeats, opens its settle watch, and - because the wedge is
#      held past the 5s window - commits to in-place recovery. It logs
#      "recovering local windows in place", captures the layout, and then blocks
#      in the re-dial against the frozen agent.
#   3. STILL SUSPENDED, close tab 0 over IPC. `Connection.closeChannel` is a
#      fire-and-forget control write, so this needs nothing from the frozen
#      agent, and the request RETURNING is proof it was served while the dial
#      was still in flight. That ordering is asserted, not assumed - without it
#      a pass would say nothing (C1/C2), and neither would a rebuild that came
#      from the ABORT path's re-entry with a fresh capture (D2).
#   4. RESUME, immediately, so the dial is still probing when the agent starts
#      answering. The rebuild then runs against a capture one tab out of date.
#
# THE ORACLE is the shell pid at each tab POSITION. Since T909 sessions are
# holder-backed, so a suspend/resume never costs a child and the surviving tabs
# keep their pids across the rebuild:
#
#   * fixed:  tabs [B, C] hold pids [P2, P3] - each tab kept its own session.
#   * broken: live tab 0 (B) pairs with captured tab 0 (A), whose session the
#             close just ENDED, so it re-opens with a brand-new pid; live tab 1
#             (C) pairs with captured tab 1 and comes back holding P2 - B's
#             session, in C's tab.
#
# Both halves of that are checked: the pids, and the surface set (a rebuild
# replaces every `GhozttyTerminal` child, which is what proves a rebuild ran at
# all rather than the recovery having quietly done nothing).
#
# -NegativeControl inverts the load-bearing claim (D4) so a run MUST fail,
# proving the oracle discriminates rather than passing for free.
#
# Hermetic: a per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA + GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN + private IPC
# suffix, and it only ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched from
# this repo's zig-out. Runs on a BACKGROUND desktop (T217), so the chord that
# makes a tab is POSTED and never steals the user's foreground.
