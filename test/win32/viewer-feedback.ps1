# T634 acceptance: the viewer feedback composer's CHROME.
#
# What is asserted, in the shape the task's validation criteria ask for:
#
#   A. the feedback button OPENS the composer: a `GhozttyViewerFeedback` child
#      window appears, visible, directly under the nav bar.
#   B. the nav bar stays visible the whole time the composer is open -- it
#      carries the only affordance that closes it, so it must not auto-hide
#      out from under it.
#   C. the page is INSET by the composer's band, and gets the space back when
#      it closes (the WebView2 widget's own top edge moves, both ways).
#   D. the pill GROWS with its content and SHRINKS again: typed newlines make
#      the band taller, backspacing them makes it shorter.
#   E. Escape closes it (a pane-scoped chord, live only in the composer).
#   F. text typed into the composer SURVIVES closing and reopening -- the
#      state lives on the pane, not on the toolbar window.
#   G. Ctrl+Enter sends, and a COMPLETE report folder lands in the throwaway
#      repo's `temp/feedback/new/` (T636): the queue is polled the way a
#      watcher polls it, so a folder seen without its `report.json` would fail
#      the atomicity assertion; the JSON's worktree branch/commit are the
#      throwaway repo's exact revision; and the composer empties and closes
#      itself behind the confirmation.
#   H. the composer's chords are PANE-SCOPED: Escape and Ctrl+Enter delivered
#      to a terminal pane produce no composer activity at all.
#   J. the two circular actions EXPLAIN THEMSELVES and answer the KEYBOARD
#      (T640): each has a tooltip naming what it does and its chord, registered
#      on its forgiving hit box; Tab walks text -> "+" -> send -> text and
#      shift+Tab walks back; and Space or Enter on the focused button does what
#      a click does. Both halves are accessibility -- before this the only way
#      to learn what a button did was to press it, and the only way to press
#      one was with a mouse.
#
# ORACLES, and why they are what they are. This runs on the BACKGROUND test
# desktop, where CopyFromScreen and SendInput are dead (T233), so nothing out
# here can look at a painted pill. Two things are readable instead, and both
# are the real thing rather than a proxy:
#
#   * the composer is a REAL child window, so its class, visibility and rect
#     are readable with the ordinary window helpers -- that is what makes A,
#     C and D geometric assertions rather than log-scraping.
#   * the pane states each open/close in its own stderr:
#         viewer feedback pane=<id> open=<bool> bar_h=<px> worktree=<path>
#             staging=<worktree-relative draft folder, or <none>>
#     and each send as
#         viewer feedback pane=<id> action=send bytes=<n> quotes=<n> ...
#         viewer feedback pane=<id> filed=<bool> stem=<name> status=<text>
#     which is what F and G read. G's real oracle, though, is the FILE the
#     send produced -- a watcher's view of the report rather than the pane's
#     view of itself.
#
# KNOWN HARNESS LIMIT: a posted Ctrl+Enter needs the app's own GetKeyState to
# see the modifier, which a plain PostMessage cannot arrange. Send-TestViewerChord
# attaches to the app's input queue first, which is exactly why it is used for
# G. The pure classification (plain Enter is a NEWLINE, never a send) is pinned
# by unit tests in `viewer_accel.zig` -- this script asserts the wiring.

# The composer's text surface is a WebView2 contenteditable since T934; the
# RichEdit below it is the FALLBACK that still ships (a box with no working
# environment still gets a composer) and is retired by T937. Every arm in this
# file drives the surface with window messages -- Send-TestControlText,
# Send-TestControlKey, Get-TestControlText -- which reach a native control and
# cannot reach a Chromium window from the background test desktop, where
# SendInput and CopyFromScreen are dead (T233).
#
# So this suite pins itself to the fallback and keeps proving the EDITING
# semantics on a control it can actually drive, and the web surface's own
# acceptance lives in `test\win32\viewer-composer.ps1` (its structure and
# lifecycle) plus the in-process `host floor` test in `ViewerPane.zig`, which
# drives a REAL controller end to end -- open, seed, quote, send, report on
# disk. T937 removes the fallback and re-points these arms.

    # --- K. an IME's composed text lands, and the mirror ends correct (T642) --
    # T635's whole argument for a RichEdit is that IME comes from the OS. That
    # claim went unproven for a month because this box has ONE input method
    # installed (en-US 0409:00000409) and no way to add a Japanese one without
    # elevation and a language download -- a system-wide change to the user's
    # daily-driver machine that no acceptance run gets to make.
    #
    # What CAN be driven without an IME, measured on this box, is the message
    # an IME actually delivers its result with: RichEdit inserts the character
    # from WM_IME_CHAR itself, inside a composition bracket or outside one,
    # with no composition context to read. So the arms below post the real
    # sequence -- WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION, the composed characters, then
    # WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION -- and assert the two things this side of the
    # boundary owns: the text reaches the control, and the pane's mirrored
    # buffer is correct AFTER the composition ends rather than merely non-empty
    # during it.
    #
    # What this canNOT prove, and where that check lives instead, is written
