# Every release ships Windows too, and ships BOTH Windows artifacts (T38).
#
# Before this, the Windows terminal was published by hand from this box
# (scripts\publish-windows-release.ps1) and the macOS app was published by a
# tag push. The two drifted exactly as far as you would expect: the Mac
# channel was at v1.28.0 and the Windows channel at win-v1.4.1 - 24 releases
# where a Windows user saw nothing. So the artifacts are now built by
# .github/workflows/release-windows.yml on the SAME tag push that builds the
# DMG, from the same script the on-box path runs.
#
# What this asserts, in the order the release actually happens:
#
#   A  pure/static: the tag trigger cannot diverge from release.yml, the tag
#      the workflow publishes is the one the app's update check scans for,
#      and the artifact NAMES agree across all three places that write them
#      (workflow, shared script, on-box script). Plus: the on-box script
#      PARSES - a UTF-8 em dash in a BOM-less .ps1 decodes to a cp1252 smart
#      quote under PS 5.1 and closed a string, which made the whole publish
#      script unparseable under `powershell -File` from the day it was
#      written until T38. A parse gate is the only thing that catches that.
#   B  live packaging: the FILEVERSION rule has exactly one live definition
#      (MSI half - needs Docker and the msitools-local image), and the portable
#      ZIP really contains the MSI's payload under a single Ghoztty/ root, twin
#      included (ZIP half - needs only bash + python3, so it runs here).
#   C  the documented process points at the automated one.
#   D  -Full only: the whole on-box publish, -DryRun, end to end. Off by
#      default because it runs a multi-minute ReleaseFast build.
#
# Read-only apart from zig-out artifact files and a temp dir; never launches
# the app, never publishes anything (D stops at -DryRun).
#
# isolation: none - no ghoztty binary is ever run here. The packaging sections
# BUILD artifacts and read their bytes back (entry sets, PE headers), which
# needs no endpoint at all; the CLI verbs that appear below are quoted inside
# comments explaining what a user's broken `ghoztty +list` looked like.

# A clean green run stamps the covered files (T783) so scripts\guard-due.ps1
# can answer "has this harness been run against the release wiring as it now
# stands?". Red leaves both stamps alone: red stays due.
#
# THREE STAMPS, THREE BARS (T898, split by T1052). One bar for all of them is
# what left this harness's guard permanently due on a box where Docker is
# deliberately kept down -- an edit to fork-ci.yml could not be cleared by any
# run, twelve turns filed a duplicate task about it, and every commit in
# between used `-NoGuardDue`. Each row is stamped by the evidence that actually
# covers its files, and by nothing weaker.
#
#   release-artifacts (wiring)     stamped by any run with zero FAILURES.
#     Sections A, C, E and F prove the workflows, the shared artifact and
#     msitools scripts, the on-box publish script and this harness end to end,
#     and not one of them touches Docker. A skipped section B says nothing
#     about them.
#   release-artifacts-zip          stamped when section B actually BUILT a ZIP
#     and read its entry set back -- which needs bash + python3 and no Docker,
#     so it happens on any box with git installed. This is the row that would
#     have caught a payload missing ghoztty.com; while it was welded to the
#     Docker bar below, nothing on this box could go red over it (T1052).
#   release-artifacts-packaging    stamped only by a run with zero skips too.
#     Its file (build-msi.sh) is only really proved by section B compiling it
#     under the msitools-local image, so a Docker-less run must not vouch for
#     it. That bar is unchanged; what changed in T1189 is what a due row COSTS.
#     It is ADVISORY now (scripts\guard-due.ps1): reported by every claim,
#     never failing the pre-commit gate, and clearable from the fork-ci run that
#     compiled the same bytes -
#       powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\guard-due.ps1 stamp-ci -Guard release-artifacts-packaging
