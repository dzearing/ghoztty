# The upgrade must not FORK the loop (tracker T138).
#
# `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` was written when killing ghoztty.exe killed the
# Claude session inside it, so it always relaunched `claude --continue` after
# the swap. Session persistence (T89) ended that: the agent owns the PTY, the
# script deliberately never kills it, and the relaunched app RE-ATTACHES the
# pane - so the old session is still there and the relaunch adds a SECOND one
# on the same transcript. Both then pick the same task (user-hit 2026-07-28:
# claude pid 16076 from 08:01 was still alive next to pid 644 started 09:46 by
# the script, and both started building T131).
#
# Sections:
#   A  pure: the resume decision, the prompt derivation, the process-identity
#      guard, and the `+sessions --json` parser. A's parser cases carry the
#      pre-fix oracle: the old line-by-line reader finds 0 sessions in the
#      output the command actually prints, which is why SESSIONS-SURVIVE had
#      been silently skipping since T89h.
#   B  E2E reuse: a live pane plus a live "loop process" -> the script swaps
#      the binaries, brings the app back, types the prompt into the EXISTING
#      pane, and starts nothing new. The headline assert is the fork one:
#      afterwards there is exactly one loop process and no new window.
#   C  E2E relaunch: the loop process is dead -> the old behavior is intact,
#      a window opens running the resume command.
#
# Hermetic: a sandbox install dir + staging dir + LOCALAPPDATA + TEMP under
# %TEMP%\ghoztty-upgrade-nofork-<pid>, so it never touches the user's
# installed release, the real upgrade log, or the real agent. It only ever
# kills processes running out of that sandbox.
#
# The isolation needs one more knob than the other suites: the local agent's
# pipe is `\\.\pipe\ghoztty-agent[-debug]-<USERNAME>`, which is NOT covered by
# a private LOCALAPPDATA. Left alone, this sandbox's app binds (or finds) the
# box's REAL debug agent while reading port.json/sessions.json out of the
# sandbox - a half-isolated state where sessions look dead to `+sessions` and
# restore, and the reuse path can never pass. Overriding $env:USERNAME gives
# the sandbox its own pipe lineage, so no other agent on the box is disturbed
# (the other suites get there by killing every zig-out agent first).
