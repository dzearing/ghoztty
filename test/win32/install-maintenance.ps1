# Re-running the installer for the version you already have must SAY SO (T1291).
#
# THE DEFECT, in the user's words on 2026-09-03: "I also tried installing the
# msi with a version already installed and it just silently quit. […] there
# should be some message to ask what to do (reinstall, cancel) that's a standard
# dialog to let you know you're already good, not just silently fail."
#
# Why it was silent, and why nothing logged a problem: an MSI whose ProductCode
# is already installed puts Windows Installer into MAINTENANCE mode, and
# maintenance mode hands the whole question - repair? change? remove? - to the
# package's authored UI. This package has none, deliberately: a double-clicked
# install is a progress bar and then a terminal, with no wizard anywhere. So
# there was nothing to show, no feature state changed, and msiexec exited 0
# without a word. Every part of that was working as designed.
#
# The fix under test: the package asks THE APP. The app puts up the dark Ghoztty
# dialog relabelled Repair / Cancel and answers with its exit code - 0 for
# Repair, 1602 for Cancel.
#
# T1730: HOW the package runs it. T1291 made it an EXE custom action (type 50)
# on the premise that an exit code of 1602 ends the install quietly. It does
# not: an EXE action's non-zero exit is always a failure, so Cancel raised
# error 1722 and msiexec ended at 1603 (found by install-walkthrough.ps1 against
# a real msiexec, T1302). So the package now runs a DLL action from its Binary
# table - MaintenancePromptCA in ghoztty-msi-ca.dll (install_ca.zig) - which
# starts the exe, waits, and RETURNS ERROR_INSTALL_USEREXIT on 1602 and success
# otherwise. Only an action's return value can be a user exit.
#
# What this asserts:
#
#   A  the shipped shape: the flag, the two exit codes, the relabelled buttons,
#      the early-exit hook in main, the lane wiring, the MSI's four custom
#      actions with their conditions and their hand-written sequence numbers -
#      the band between CostFinalize and InstallValidate, ahead of the prepare
#      step - and the Upgrade table's three separate version bands (so
#      "you already have this" is never announced as "a newer version").
#   E  the build-time read-back can say no: the verifier that ships inside
#      build-msi.sh is extracted and fed each broken CustomAction /
#      InstallExecuteSequence / Upgrade table it exists to reject (T1133).
#      Needs python and nothing else - no Docker, no msitools, no MSI.
#   L  the LIVE behaviour, against the real debug build: the dialog actually
#      appears, its buttons actually say Repair and Cancel, and clicking each
#      one leaves the process with the exit code msiexec has to see. L5 is the
#      control - the seam that answers without a dialog agrees with the dialog,
#      so neither half can be passing for the trivial reason.
#
# What is deliberately NOT here: a real msiexec maintenance run. That lives in
# install-walkthrough.ps1 section D, which installs a real package under a
# throwaway identity and presses both buttons. The MSI half is asserted here at
# its source and at its build-time read-back; the dialog and its exit codes are
# measured live.
#
# Runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so the
# modal dialog never takes the user's foreground.
#
# isolation: partial - launches the repo debug build as a prompt process only.
# It creates no window of the terminal, binds no IPC endpoint and starts no
# agent; every process it starts is tracked by pid on the test desktop.
