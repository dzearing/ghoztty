# Startup-failure visibility acceptance (tracker T1177).
#
# THE DEFECT: `ghoztty.exe` is a GUI-subsystem binary, so it has no console and
# nothing it writes to stderr is ever seen. Every startup error therefore
# unwound out of `main` into nothing at all - the process exited, no window
# appeared, and the user was left looking at a shortcut that did nothing. On a
# freshly installed machine that is the entire experience: silence, and then,
# minutes later, some unrelated probe timing out. The user's words were "this is
# a completely unacceptable user experience".
#
# THE CONTRACT this asserts:
#
#   1. A startup that ends with NO WINDOW raises a dialog instead of exiting
#      silently. The dialog is Ghoztty's own dark one (class
#      `GhozttyConfirmDialog`), titled "Ghoztty could not start".
#   2. It arrives FAST - seconds, not after any probe deadline. Asserted as a
#      measured elapsed time, not as "it eventually showed up".
#   3. Its text is written for a person: it names the stage, the error, a
#      remedy, and where the log is. A dialog that says only "error 5" would
#      pass a mere existence check and fail the user, so the BODY is read back
#      out of the live dialog (WM_GETTEXT on its statics) and asserted on.
#   4. Dismissing it ends the process with a NONZERO exit code - a failed launch
#      must not look like a successful one to whatever started it (the
#      installer's launch step, T1176, is now one such caller).
#   5. The negative control: with the seam off, the same build opens a real
#      window and raises NO such dialog. Without this arm every assertion above
#      would still pass against a build that shows the dialog unconditionally.
#   6. A display that cannot run the renderer is EXPLAINED rather than blamed on
#      the install (T1224). Over Remote Desktop the display driver offers
#      OpenGL 1.1, Ghoztty needs 4.3, and the dialog the user got said
#      "reinstall it" - the one remedy that cannot possibly work. Arm E reads
#      the live dialog back and asserts it names the version actually found,
#      names Remote Desktop as the usual cause, and does NOT send the user to
#      reinstall.
#   7. And when there IS something else to try, the terminal tries it instead of
#      refusing (T1251). Arm F puts a fallback OpenGL implementation within
#      reach of the same forced-1.1 state and asserts the app comes UP on it -
#      window open, no dialog, and the log naming the implementation it drew
#      with. Arm E and arm F are the two endings of the same condition, and
#      neither is safe to ship without the other: E alone permits a build that
#      never falls back, F alone permits a build that never refuses.
#   8. And the thing it tries is the one we SHIP (T1252). Arm F names a stand-in
#      fallback through a debug seam, which proves the selection but says
#      nothing about whether an installed Ghoztty has anything to select. Arm H
#      removes the seam entirely: the only fallback in reach is the vendored
#      Mesa at `<dir holding ghoztty.exe>\gl\opengl32.dll` that `zig build`
#      installs, and the terminal has to come up drawing with it.
#
# The state in arm 1-4 is built with `GHOZTTY_STARTUP_FAIL=no-window`, a
# DEBUG-ONLY seam in `App.run` that suppresses the startup window. It is the
# same shape as the `GHOZTTY_RESTORE_SKIP` seam beside it and it exists for the
# same reason: there is no supported way to make window creation fail from
# outside the process, and the alternative is a guard nobody has ever seen fire.
# The seam suppresses the WINDOW, never the guard - so what runs here is the
# shipping guard, the shipping error, the shipping reporter and the shipping
# dialog.
#
# Runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so it
# never takes the user's foreground, and hermetically: private IPC endpoint,
# per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA, and it only ever kills ghoztty processes launched
# from the repo zig-out.
