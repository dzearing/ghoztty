# Machine-chooser SESSION RESUME acceptance (tracker T320).
#
# T318/T319 made the selected machine's sessions VISIBLE. This is the task that
# makes one of them openable: the keyboard sub-cursor steps into the roster
# (Right), walks it (Up/Down), and Return dismisses the chooser and opens a
# window whose pane ATTACHes to that session - Mac's `WindowTarget.resumeSession`
# (MachineChooserView.swift:20, :127-133, :167-170).
#
# What this drives, end to end, against a REAL local agent:
#
#   1. a session the app does NOT have open is resumable at all. The fixture
#      runs panes under the agent, kills the APP (not the agent), and relaunches
#      with GHOZTTY_RESTORE_SKIP=1 — the T620 seam that forces the real
#      degradation where neither restore source yields a window (manifest gone,
#      GET_LAYOUTS faulted). The agent then holds live children with no viewer.
#      Dropping the manifest alone stopped working when launch-time restore
#      learned to recover such a window from the agent's own layout store
#      (T194); a second-instance fixture is no better, because the manifest and
#      layout store are shared across pipe-suffix instances and the adopting
#      launch STEALS the other instance's session (see T620).
#   2. Right paints the cursor - the first card's fill picks up the accent wash
#      it did not have a moment earlier (the plain card is its own control).
#   3. Return resumes THAT row: the app logs the id it attached, the chooser
#      closes, and - the independent oracle - `ghoztty +sessions --json`, which
#      dials the agent directly and never goes through the app, flips that
#      session's `attached` from false to true.
#   4. a session whose program has EXITED is not offered at all (D91/T1364).
#      The user's rule is that the list means "what is still running that you
#      have no window on", so a tombstone - relaunchable or not - is simply not
#      a row. T466 read D91's question the other way and listed such rows with a
#      "can relaunch" badge, which made the list grow with finished work every
#      time the box rebooted. The fixture kills the agent to produce tombstones,
#      then asserts their ABSENCE two ways: the roster's own oracle line
#      ("chooser roster: listing N session(s), M exited hidden"), cross-checked
#      against `+sessions --json`, and a keyboard walk over the whole rendered
#      list that never lands on one. The agent keeps the tombstones, because
#      launch-time restore still revives them from a saved layout.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL for (4): section 4 reopens the chooser and acts on a LIVE
# row with the same keys. Section 3's headline assertion is an ABSENCE, which a
# dialog that ignored every keystroke would also satisfy - so the control is
# what separates "the tombstones are gone" from "nothing in here works at all"
# (the T240 lesson).
#
# T248: the repo's agent AND its app are killed at setup and the agent's state
# is dropped, so the fixture is built fresh instead of measuring the previous
# run's sessions.
# T267: the script sets its own window size rather than inheriting whatever the
# last GUI script left in window_placement-debug.
