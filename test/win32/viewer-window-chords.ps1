# T682 acceptance: the WINDOW-scoped chords a focused viewer pane can reach.
#
# THE BUG. `viewer_accel.forwards()` names the bound actions a focused viewer
# hands back to the app; everything it does not name stays with the WebView2
# page. T126 found `toggle_hero_mode` missing from that list and added it. The
# same sweep left two behind: `reset_window_size` and `toggle_tab_overview`,
# both implemented on win32, both window-scoped, and both dead while a viewer
# held focus - a viewer-only window has no terminal to press them from at all.
# The `else` arm of `Window.performViewerBindingAction` logged a drift warning
# nobody reads, which is how the gap stayed quiet. (The list and the switch are
# now held together at COMPILE time - `Window.viewer_dispatch_tags` - so the
# next one cannot be a log line. This script measures the behavior.)
#
# THE ORACLES, and why there are two.
#   - SIZE: GetClientRect of the top-level GhozttyWindow. `reset_window_size`
#     has a visible effect, so the subject arm is a real measurement.
#   - THE PAGE'S OWN KEY LOG: `toggle_tab_overview` is a deliberate no-op on
#     this platform (as on Mac - only the GTK apprt has an overview to show),
#     so "it worked" cannot be seen in the window. What IS observable, and is
#     the whole reason to forward it, is that the app CLAIMS the chord instead
#     of letting it fall through to the page - which is what a terminal pane
#     does with it. The served page mirrors every keydown it sees into
#     `document.title`, which `DocumentTitleChanged` carries into the leaf's
#     title in `+list --json` (viewer-panes.ps1 section 11d's oracle).
#
# THREE POSITIVE CONTROLS, because every claim here is of the form "nothing
# happened" and would pass for free against dead key injection (T216):
#   A. f8 = toggle_maximize, ALREADY forwarded before this task: pressed at the
#      viewer it must maximize. If it does not, injection is broken and the run
#      ABORTS rather than returning a T682 verdict.
#   B. f10, bound to NOTHING: the page must record it. Proves the page's key
#      log is live, so "the page did not see f9" means something.
#   C. f7 = clear_screen, a bound action `forwards()` deliberately does NOT
#      admit: the page must record it too. That is the other half of the rule -
#      terminal-content actions stay with the page - and it is what keeps this
#      script honest about a build that simply claimed every chord.
#
# Pre-fix shape: f9 and f6 appear in the page's key log and the window never
# resizes. -NegativeControl asserts exactly that, so it must FAIL on a healthy
# build.
