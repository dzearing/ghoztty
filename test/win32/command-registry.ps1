# T189 acceptance: the command palette runs off the SHARED command registry.
#
# T189 moved the palette's private `palette_entries` array out of Surface.zig
# into `commands.zig`, so the palette and the menu system (T143/T190) render
# one list and dispatch through one path (`Surface.performCommand`). The unit
# tests in the none lane cover the model; this script covers the two things
# only the running app can answer:
#
#   A. a command that was ALREADY in the palette still dispatches after the
#      refactor (regression: the palette is the app's most-used command
#      surface and its dispatch path was rewritten), and
#   B. a command that reached the palette only BECAUSE of the shared registry
#      dispatches too - `Show/Hide All Terminals` (toggle_visibility) had a
#      binding and no palette row before T189.
#
# Both are asserted by OUTCOME, not by reading palette text: a row that is
# absent cannot dispatch, so an outcome is proof of presence as well. A
# negative control (a filter that matches nothing) must dispatch nothing, so
# a passing A/B cannot be "Enter does something no matter what".
#
# A positive control (ctrl+k clear_screen, the T55 pattern) runs first, so an
# injection failure aborts instead of reading as a T189 regression.
#
# T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1),
# so it never takes the user's foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed.
# The private win32 driver this script used to carry is gone. Note the split
# the harness enforces: the palette is OPENED with a chord on the terminal
# surface (Send-TestKeys), but its search box is a standard EDIT, so the
# filter goes in as WM_CHAR and Enter/Escape as posted navigation keys
# (Send-TestControlText / Send-TestControlKey).
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
