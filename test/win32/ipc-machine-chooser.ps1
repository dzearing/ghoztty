# Machine-chooser acceptance (tracker T22c): ctrl+shift+n opens the "New
# Remote Window" picker, which fetches the signed-in account's enrolled relay
# devices and (on selection) dials one through the shared open path. The dialog
# is GUI, so this drives the REAL ctrl+shift+n chord into the debug build's
# surface and asserts the open+fetch path end to end:
#
#   1. a debug log line proves the chord reached openMachineChooser;
#   2. a GhozttyMachineChooser window appears;
#   3. the chooser performed GET /v1/client/devices against a loopback fake
#      relay directory (the deterministic positive control - it only happens
#      if the chooser actually opened and ran its fetch);
#   4. the app survives opening and Escape-closing the chooser (no crash).
#
# T172 adds the look of the thing (the T140 report): the list is owner-drawn
# with two-line machine rows, the selection is an INSET rounded accent pill
# rather than a full-width system-blue bar (pixel-probed, with an unselected
# row as the negative control), the filter shows a cue banner while empty, and
# the status strip WRAPS - a second, signed-out run proves it never clips.
#
# T175 adds the SHAPE (Mac's master-detail chooser): a fixed 840x540 dialog, a
# washed machine column at the left separated by a hairline rule, a detail pane
# at the right that names the selected machine and carries the "New Window"
# primary action, and Cancel alone in the footer. The detail pane is asserted to
# FOLLOW the selection (arrow down must repaint it), and - since the window no
# longer grows - the wrapping strip now takes its extra lines out of the LIST.

# T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so
# it never takes the user's foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed. The
# private win32 driver (McDrv) is gone. What the migration changed beyond the
# mechanics:
#
#   * it no longer SKIPs. The whole script used to exit 0 with "SKIPPED
#     (foreground unavailable)" whenever another window owned the foreground,
#     so a busy box scored a green run that had asserted nothing. On the test
#     desktop the chord always lands and a missing chooser is a SETUP FAIL.
#   * the pixel probes moved from CopyFromScreen (dead off the input desktop)
#     to PrintWindow via Get-TestWindowPixels. Everything they read is the
#     dialog's own GDI chrome - the list's owner-drawn rows, the column wash,
#     the rule, the cue banner, the status strip - which is exactly the half of
#     the CAPTURE LIMIT that migrates. Each capture is guarded with
#     Get-TestDistinctColors: a window captured mid-paint comes back solid
#     black, and black satisfies a "was anything drawn?" probe while proving
#     nothing (T216).

        #      the mark at its leading edge. Drawn (brighter than the row
        #      background beside it) but carrying none of the accent, which is
        #      what says "the caret is elsewhere".
        #   2. list focused   -> the FILL stays neutral and steps up a weight
        #      (`selection_wash_unfocused` 0.10 -> `_focused` 0.16), and the
        #      accent appears on the 4x16 indicator capsule at the pill's
        #      leading edge. That is T828's treatment - Windows 11's list
        #      selection instead of Mac's tinted pill - and the indicator is
        #      the WHOLE of the row's accent, so the pill body has none.
        #   3. focus leaves   -> it goes back.
        #
        # This probe used to demand an accent TINT in the pill body (b - r >= 25
        # at Left+14) and went red the day T828 deliberately removed it. Its
        # successor is not a deletion (T988): the colour half of the oracle
        # moved to the band the accent moved to, and gained the fill-weight
        # check, so "the row repainted into the emphasized state" is still
        # measured in colour and not only in the region signature.
        #

        # signature says the row repainted at all, the tints say what it
        # repainted INTO. A signature alone would pass on any change; a tint
        # alone cannot tell a repaint from a stale capture.
        #
        # The two bands are split at the body sample: the mark lives at DIP
        # 6..10 (`fill_inset_x` + `xs`, 4 wide), the body sample at +14 is past
