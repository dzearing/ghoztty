# T445 acceptance: a read-only pane wears a badge, per pane, and the badge is
# the way back out of the mode.
#
# Read-only drops every keystroke on the floor. Until this task the win32
# `.readonly` apprt action was an acknowledged no-op, so a read-only pane and
# a wedged pane looked exactly alike and the only way to tell them apart was
# to open the context menu and look for a checkmark. The badge
# (class GhozttyReadonlyBadge, a WS_EX_LAYERED popup owned by the pane's
# surface HWND, `ReadonlyBadge.zig`) is the mark.
#
# Runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1), so it never
# steals the user's foreground - asserted here, not assumed.
#
# ORACLES. All structural, none pixel-based, and that is a decision rather
# than an omission:
#
#   - EXISTENCE + VISIBILITY of the badge window, per pane. A popup is its own
#     top-level window, so `Get-TestWindows -Class GhozttyReadonlyBadge` sees
#     it off the input desktop exactly as on it.
#   - WHICH PANE it marks, by rect containment against each pane's own rect.
#     This is the assertion that a tab-title glyph could not have made, and
#     the reason decision D30 chose a per-pane badge.
#   - THE ANCHOR, computed rather than eyeballed. The badge's window is the
#     card plus its shadow allowance, so the gap from the pane's top and right
#     edges is exactly `round(INSET*s) - (round(SHADOW_BLUR*s) +
#     round(SHADOW_DY*s))` = 8s - (4s + 2s) in DIP. Recomputed here from the
#     window's real DPI, which is what makes it a regression test for the
#     geometry and not a restatement of it.
#
# CAPTURE LIMIT, named rather than quietly dropped: the badge paints through
# UpdateLayeredWindow and never services WM_PAINT, so PrintWindow (what
# Get-TestWindowPixels uses) has nothing to render and cannot confirm the
# CARD's colors or the label. Those are covered where they are decidable
# instead - `readonly_badge.zig`'s unit tests assert the card's opacity, its
# fill, the drop shade's falloff, the border ring's color, and both WCAG
# floors, swept over the whole background ramp at 1.0/1.25/1.5/2.0.
#
# A positive control (ctrl+k clear_screen, the T55/T74 pattern) runs first, so
# a broken injection aborts with a diagnosis instead of reading as a T445
# regression.
#
# Only touches ghoztty processes running from this repo's zig-out*.
