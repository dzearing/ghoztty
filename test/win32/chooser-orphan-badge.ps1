# Machine-chooser ORPHAN MARK acceptance (tracker T520).
#
# The chooser's local roster now marks each live session that no local pane
# holds - the "not in any window" badge - so a left-over session (the agent
# holds it, nothing shows it) is distinguishable at a glance from one that some
# other window has. This script drives the mark's whole life cycle against a
# REAL local agent:
#
#   1. POSITIVE/NEGATIVE CONTROL: with every session held by an open pane, the
#      roster says "0 session(s) not in any window" - the oracle line fires
#      even at zero, so the mark's ABSENCE is asserted, not assumed.
#   2. OPEN a session directly against the agent (remote-test-client --hold,
#      the T411/T108 shape: the client detaches and the session stays alive
#      with no pane) - reopening the chooser counts exactly that one.
#   3. Resume the marked row from the roster (the T320 path); reopening the
#      chooser shows the count back at zero - the mark clears the moment a
#      window holds the session. The cursor is walked to the marked row by the
#      app's own "chooser roster: cursor on session id=..." log through
#      lib\ChooserCursor.ps1, never by counting Downs off `+sessions --json`
#      (T1106): the roster is sorted, so that count is the wrong index space,
#      and Right does nothing at all while the roster is still being fetched.
#
# WHY A LOG LINE IS THE ORACLE. The roster is owner-drawn on the dialog's own
# surface - there is no HWND to read a badge back from - so the count is said
# out loud per adopted local roster (SessionRoster.logOrphans) and
# cross-checked here against an INDEPENDENT source: `ghoztty +sessions --json`,
# which dials the agent directly and never goes through the app. Because the
# same count can legitimately repeat across chooser opens, every wait is on the
# NUMBER of matching lines rising past a baseline, never on "a line exists".
#
# WHY NOT the kill-the-app-and-drop-the-manifest fixture chooser-resume.ps1
# uses: since T194 the launch restore also consults the agent's own layout
# blobs, so a relaunch re-attaches everything and no orphan survives it. The
# direct-OPEN client is the shape that stays orphaned by construction.
#
# T248: the repo's agent AND app are killed at setup and the agent's state is
# dropped, so the fixture is built fresh every run.
# T267: the script sets its own window size rather than inheriting one.
