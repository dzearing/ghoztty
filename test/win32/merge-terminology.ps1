# T1097 meta-check: "merge back" never appears bare in the live tree again.
#
# Why: the phrase names THREE unrelated operations in this repo and nothing in
# the wording tells them apart -
#
#   cutover        `users/dzearing/windows-amd64` -> `main` on dzearing/ghoztty.
#                  The goal. Gated by scripts\ship-readiness.ps1, executed by
#                  T1074.
#   upstream pull  ghostty-org/ghostty -> this fork. Allowed, on the user's call
#                  only, mac build first (D80). Planned in
#                  docs\design\windows-parity-upstream-pull-plan.md.
#   upstreaming    this fork -> ghostty-org/ghostty. NEVER happens; the
#                  `upstream` remote is fetch-only by construction (D80).
#
# On 2026-08-22 that collision cost a full round trip with the user twice and
# produced a wrong correction that had to be undone: a digest sentence reading
# "the merge back to upstream Ghostty actually began" was read as this fork
# preparing pull requests against the public Ghostty project, and a task (T1095)
# was filed on the misreading and had to be closed again. CLAUDE.md now bans the
# bare phrase. This script is what makes the ban hold - a rule in a doc that
# nothing checks is a rule that decays.
#
# THE RULE. `merge back` / `merge-back` / `merged back` / `merging back` is a
# finding unless it is REPORTED rather than USED. Two shapes count as reported:
#
#   a quoted mention  - `"merge back"` in a sentence about the phrase itself,
#                       which is exactly what CLAUDE.md, D80 and the two plan
#                       docs do when they explain the ban;
#   a quotation       - a double-quoted span or a markdown blockquote carrying
#                       somebody else's words. The user's own cutover directive
#                       is quoted verbatim in ship-readiness.ps1,
#                       ship-feature.ps1 and the ship-workflow doc, and editing
#                       a quote to fit a naming rule falsifies it.
#
# A quotation is bounded - under 800 characters and no blank line inside - so an
# unbalanced quote mark cannot silently exempt the rest of a file. Everything
# else has to say WHICH merge it means.
#
# WHAT IS HISTORY, and therefore never scanned: the dated digests, the session
# log, the audit / details / spec / divergence / feature-ideas files, every
# decision record (a decision preserves the question AS IT WAS ASKED, including
# the user's verbatim words - rewriting one would falsify the record), and any
# task file already `done` or `skipped(...)`. Inside a still-open task file the
# `## Progress log` is history too and is skipped, so a dated journal entry does
# not have to be edited to keep the tree green.
#
# Sections:
#
#   A  the scanner itself bites (synthetic fixtures, both directions)
#   B  the live tree is clean
#   C  the three senses are each named where a reader lands: the plan doc, the
#      ship-workflow doc and CLAUDE.md all carry the disambiguation
#   D  the renamed plan doc is the one on disk (T1132)
#
# Static scan, no app, no CLI - safe on the off-desktop harness.
