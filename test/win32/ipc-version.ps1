# nonzero on any failure. Only touches ghoztty processes from zig-out.
#
# Covers:
#   1. `+version` prints a "Running Instance" section whose commit/mode/
#      runtime/exe/pid identify the serving instance.
#   2. `+list --json` carries the same provenance as data.build.
#   3. Palette "About Ghoztty" entry opens the About box (chord-injected;
#      the palette-popup assert is the input-injection positive control).
#   4. `+version` with no instance still succeeds and says so.
#
# T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1),
# so it never takes the user's foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed.
# The private VerDrv driver (GrabForeground + SendInput) is gone; the harness
# supplies the equivalents. The app is launched ONTO the desktop rather than
# auto-spawned by `+new-window`, which would have put it on the user's.

# aside and put a fresh file at its path. Windows refuses to write - or even to
# re-stamp - a file that is mapped for execution (setting LastWriteTimeUtc on it
# fails with "used by another process"), but it has always allowed the rename,
# and the handle follows the file. That is precisely the move msiexec and
# `update_install.sidelineName` make, so this is the real state rather than a
# simulation of it: same path, newer file, process still on the old bytes.
