.SYNOPSIS
    T1039 acceptance - a run that DID NOT FINISH must not print ALL PASS, and
    must not stamp its guard.

.DESCRIPTION
    Four sections:

      A. The shared scorer ON THE WIRE (`lib\TestScore.ps1`). Fixture scripts
         are launched as real processes and their last line and exit code read
         back, because the defect is a property of the process - what the run
         PRINTED and what it EXITED with over a body that unwound - not of a
         function return value. Section A3 reproduces the original shape rather
         than a stand-in: `Get-Content -Raw` on an empty file answers $null, and
         `$null.Trim()` is the statement-terminating error that ended T329's
         run at the top of its last section.

      B. The STAMP gate (`scripts\guard-due.ps1 update`), against a throwaway
         repo. This is the half that outlives the run: a red line scrolls away,
         a stamp keeps a guard quiet until the covered files change again. Both
         directions - an unwound run writes no stamp, a finished one still does.

      C. The analyzer (`lib\BodyCompleteAudit.ps1`) against fixtures, both
         directions: a correctly marked script yields nothing, each violating
         shape is named, and a guarded expression at the top level - the
         `try { $x = [int]$s } catch { $x = 0 }` idiom - is NOT reported, since
         an audit that cries about six of those is an audit nobody reads.

      D. The sweep over `test\win32\*.ps1`: no script scored by the shared
         scorer may still have an unwind path to a green verdict.

    `-TeethCheck` proves the section-D assertion can fail: it injects a
    synthesized violator and requires the sweep to go red. Run it after any
    change to the analyzer.

    One `ALL PASS` / `N FAILURE(S)` line last, per the house convention.
