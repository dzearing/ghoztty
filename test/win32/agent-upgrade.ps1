# T147 acceptance: NON-DESTRUCTIVE local-agent upgrade delivery.
#
# The defect: the upgrade script deliberately swaps ghoztty-agent.exe WITHOUT
# killing the running agent (T89h) - killing it is the silent session reset
# docs/claude/sessions.md's "Agent contract & upgrade compatibility" section forbids. But
# nothing then ever ADOPTED the new binary, so an agent-side fix reached the
# user only after a reboot. The app now compares the running agent's HELLO build
# stamp against the one it ships beside, and refreshes at the two safe moments -
# silently when nothing is live, and never silently when something is.
#
# Measured by OUTCOME (agent pids, dialogs on screen, panes that still answer),
# not by log scraping:
#
#   A: premise - `ghoztty-agent --version` prints a parseable stamp. Everything
#      below rests on it, so it is asserted rather than assumed.
#   B: negative control - a CURRENT agent is never touched. No dialog, same
#      agent pid, pane still responsive after a full check cycle.
#   C: stale + a live session => NOTHING HAPPENS. No dialog, the same agent pid,
#      the live pane untouched, and the decision logged as a deliberate
#      leave-alone. This is T1056's contract assert (see below).
#   E: the adoption promise - closing the last pane makes the agent idle, and the
#      refresh then happens SILENTLY (new agent pid, no dialog anywhere in the
#      arm). "Ghoztty updates automatically the next time no sessions are open"
#      is a promise the code has to keep, and it is the whole reason leaving a
#      live agent alone costs the user nothing.
#   F: negative control - session-persistence=off never runs the check at all.
#   H: T229/T1056 - the user's shape: RESTORED windows, several BUSY sessions, a
#      stale agent. The app leaves every one of them alone. This is the arm that
#      stands for the 95 sessions the Mac 1.33.0 update tombstoned.
#   I: negative control - a refresh that CANNOT re-dial says so, and the app
#      stays up. Driven through the skew path, the only one that still restarts
#      an agent whose sessions are live.
#   J: T125 - a PROTOCOL SKEW (the handshake itself fails, so there is no
#      connection to judge) takes the mandatory-update path, and answering it
#      actually replaces the agent, leaves the full step trail, and brings the
#      panes back in place.
#   K: T125 negative control - a skew where the AGENT is the newer side is never
#      acted on. The app is the out-of-date one; downgrading it would eat
#      sessions a newer app could still have attached to. Plus T626: doing
#      nothing is not the same as saying nothing - the user gets a tray notice
#      naming the one act that cures it (update Ghoztty), once per run, and a
#      click on it goes looking for an update without touching the agent.
#   L: T907/T1056 - handoff-capable, but a session the agent owns DIRECTLY is
#      still live => the update drains and nobody is asked to hurry it along.
#   M: T907 - handoff-capable and every live session holder-backed => the app
#      STANDS DOWN. No dialog, the decision logged as such, no destructive
#      restart attempted, and the agent's own replacement carries the session
#      across.
#
# T1056 - what a STALE BUILD may cost the user, which is now nothing. An app
# update replaces ghoztty-agent.exe while the running agent keeps every PTY
# attached, and the staleness check used to read that build-stamp gap as grounds
# for a restart. It is not one: proto_version is negotiated in HELLO and a
# mismatch is fatal there, so an agent we can talk to has already agreed the wire
# contract, and everything since rides additive capabilities that degrade on
# their own. Mac's 1.33.0 update took that path and tombstoned 95 live sessions
# for a binary refresh nothing required.
#
# So the mandatory confirmation is now reserved for a skew the handshake actually
# flags as incompatible - arms J and I - and arms C/E/H/L assert that a stale
# BUILD produces no dialog and no restart while anything is live. Anyone reading
# "the confirmation never appears for a stale agent" as a regression should start
# here: it is the fix.
#
# T1037 - WHICH stale agent lands on WHICH policy arm, because the answer has
# changed twice under this harness and nothing was obliged to notice. T907 gave
# the agent the ability to replace ITSELF without losing a session (arm M);
# T1056 then made every OTHER live-session arm a leave-alone too. The three are
# told apart only by the decision line, so arms C/E/H/L each assert the reason
# they are named for rather than just "no dialog".
#
# Arms C/E/H/I run as the LEGACY generation via
# `GHOSTTY_AGENT_SUPPRESS_CAPS=agent_handoff` (the T469 test seam): the agent
# this tree builds then advertises what a pre-T907 agent advertised, so it cannot
# replace itself. That is the generation with the most to lose from a restart -
# it has no handoff to fall back on - and each of those arms asserts
# `handoff-capable=false` in the decision line, so an arm cannot silently stop
# exercising the case it names.
#
# The staleness INPUT is faked with GHOZTTY_AGENT_BUNDLED_VERSION (a debug-only
# hook): every stamp in a real build comes from the same binary the agent runs,
# so there is no way to fabricate an old agent from a new tree. The decision and
# the restart it drives are the shipping ones.
#
# T217: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so
# it never takes the user's foreground - asserted at the end, not assumed. The
# private win32 driver this script used to carry (its own T86 GrabForeground +
# SendInput + EnumWindows) is gone. Notes on what the harness changes here:
#
#   * The GUI is launched with Start-OnTestDesktop, so its window is created on
#     the test desktop. The env this script sets (LOCALAPPDATA,
#     GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN, GHOZTTY_AGENT_BUNDLED_VERSION,
#     GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX) still reaches it - CreateProcessW inherits the
#     harness process's block.
#   * ConfirmDialog is NOT a standard #32770: it runs its own nested pump
#     (ConfirmDialog.runModal) reading WM_KEYDOWN straight off the queue, so a
#     POSTED Escape/Tab/Enter drives it (Send-TestControlKey) with no foreground
#     grab and no focus call.
#   * The `+...` CLI invocations stay on Start-Process. They are console-only
#     and windowless; nothing about them can steal foreground, and routing them
#     through the desktop would buy nothing.
#
# Hermetic: per-run $env:LOCALAPPDATA + GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN + a private IPC
# pipe suffix, and it only ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent processes launched
# from the repo zig-out.
