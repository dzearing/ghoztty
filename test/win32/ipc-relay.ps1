# working (the connected arm is proved with a round-trip, not with a field).

# Budget: the fast ladder is 5 attempts at 1/2/4/8/15s (~30s from the drop), and
# an exhausted ladder arms a background re-dial every 45s. 150s covers the fast
# pass plus two slow re-dials, so a slow recovery reads as a recovery and not as
# a failure.
#
# Which arm this box takes TODAY is the disconnected one, and T1278 is why: a
# hard-killed `--listen` agent loses its session records, so the restarted agent
# reaps the still-live PTY holder as an orphan and the ladder is told
# `session_gone`. That is a real defect with its own task; it is NOT this
