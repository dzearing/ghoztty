# T234 acceptance: the tab strip is not painted at one tab, and the window
# menu moved into the caption bar as a "..." button.
#
# The user's report, verbatim: "don't we own the header? can't we put a '...'
# button to the left of the minimize button, and use that space? Then we do not
# need to use tabs by default, wasting precious vertical space. The mac client
# does not use tabs by default."
#
# Both halves are ONE change, which is why they are one script: the strip could
# not go away while it was the app's only menu host (that is what pinned
# `auto => true` on Windows from T190 to here), and the caption button is what
# releases it. So a run that showed the strip gone but could not open a menu
# would be a regression, not a pass.
#
# What it asserts, and how - all by geometry and by live hit tests, never by
# "the code says so":
#
#   1. ONE TAB, DEFAULT CONFIG: the first pane's top sits exactly `caption_h`
#      (4 + 28 + 4 DIP) below the client top. Not "no strip is painted" - the
#      strip's absence is only worth anything if the terminal GETS the rows,
#      and that is a measured pane offset.
#   2. POSITIVE CONTROL, same size window, --window-show-tab-bar=always: the
#      same measurement is `bar_h` - the strip lives IN the caption row since
#      T205, so a window WITH a strip spends one row, not two. Without this an
#      app that had simply stopped creating panes correctly would read as a
#      pass, and the per-window row gain is the DIFFERENCE of the two, measured
#      rather than quoted from the design doc.
#   3. THE TRANSITION, live, in one window: ctrl+t drops the pane to exactly
#      `bar_h` (the strip appeared, in the band), and closing back to one tab
#      lifts it to `caption_h` again. Panes are not lost or scrambled across
#      either. The COST of that second tab is `bar_h - caption_h` = 4 DIP,
#      asserted as itself: before T205 it was a whole 40 DIP row.
#   4. THE "..." BUTTON: WM_NCHITTEST over its square answers HTSYSMENU, which
#      is the code Windows itself uses for "the control that opens this
#      window's menu"; pressing it opens a real popup menu (a #32768 window on
#      this desktop, read live - not inferred from our own state).
#   5. NOTHING ELSE IN THE CAPTION MOVED: maximize still answers HTMAXBUTTON
#      (that code is what the Snap Layouts flyout watches for, so a button
#      inserted too close to it silently deletes a Windows 11 feature), close
#      still answers HTCLOSE, and the band left of "..." still drags.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: -NegativeControl inverts section 1 (asserts the strip IS
# up at one tab under the default config) and MUST fail.
#
# Runs on the background test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so it
