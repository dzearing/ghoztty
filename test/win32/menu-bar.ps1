# T190 acceptance: the Windows menu system - tab-strip button, HMENU host,
# dispatch, state, and keyboard activation.
#
# T189 landed the pure model (commands.zig + menu_bar.zig) and the single
# dispatch entry point; NONE of it was reachable. This script measures the
# reachable half, always by OUTCOME:
#
#   A: the menu HOST button exists and opens a menu - and it is a BUTTON, not
#      "anywhere in the strip": clicking the "+" opens a tab instead, and
#      clicking bare strip does nothing. Plus a pixel check that the glyph is
#      actually painted, with a blank strip region as its negative control.
#      Since T260 the host depends on the window: a window that draws its own
#      caption hosts the menu in the caption's "..." and its strip carries NO
#      second button (asserted here by hit test AND by pixels), while a
#      caption-less window still hosts it in the strip - which is section H.
#   B: the whole tree is there - walked RECURSIVELY, so a missing submenu
#      cannot hide behind a matching item count.
#   C: choosing a row performs its command, one representative per submenu,
#      asserted by outcome (File>New Tab grows +list; View>Terminal Read-only
#      comes back CHECKED; Window>Zoom Split hides a pane's window).
#   D: state gating is live (Copy, Close Tab, Zoom Split, the split submenus).
#   E: Exit says "(keep sessions)" only with session-persistence on (T89e).
#   F: a rebind relabels its row - the label comes from the LIVE keybind set.
#   G: keyboard activation - F10 and a lone Alt open the menu; alt+<key> does
#      not; and F10 is passed through to a full-screen TUI (alternate screen)
#      instead of opening the menu, then works again on the primary screen.
#   I: T191 - Window>Float on Top flips the window's live WS_EX_TOPMOST and the
#      row comes back CHECKED, then both revert. The action shipped with the
#      first win32 commit and had no surface whatsoever; this is the oracle for
#      the surface AND for the bit actually sticking.
#   H: T260 - a `window-decoration = none` window has no caption to host the
#      menu, so the strip keeps its "=" button there and it opens the same
#      menu. The positive control for A's "the strip has no button": without
#      it, a build that deleted the button outright would pass just as well.
#
# Menu contents are read from the LIVE popup via MN_GETHMENU + cross-process
# GetMenuItemInfo-family calls (never GetWindowTextW, which reads a cache the
# app never sees).
#
# T218: migrated onto the BACKGROUND test desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1),
# so the run never takes the user's foreground - asserted here, not assumed.
# Everything except the A(pixels) probe was already PostMessage-driven, so the
# migration is about WHERE those calls run:
#
#   * Window enumeration is desktop-bound (EnumWindows walks the CALLING
#     thread's desktop), so FindTop/FindPane/MenuWindow/VisiblePanes now go
#     through the harness's worker thread. HMENU reads are NOT - a menu handle
#     is not a desktop object - so they stay in-process here.
#   * A(pixels) dropped GrabForeground + CopyFromScreen for PrintWindow
#     (Get-TestWindowPixels). The tab strip is GDI-painted chrome, which is the
#     half of the CAPTURE LIMIT that survives a window capture (measured in
#     T218 batch 2 by tab-strip/tab-color). That also retires the section's
#     "SKIP if the box will not hand over the foreground" branch: the probe now
#     always runs, and a capture with no real content in it is a FAIL rather
#     than a silently-skipped assertion.
#   * F10 and the lone-Alt press need WM_SYSKEYDOWN/UP as separate halves (the
#     contract is about the pairing), which is what Send-TestSysKey exists for.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts the A(pixels) button-ink expectation and MUST fail;
# it is how a run proves that probe reads ink rather than returning a constant.

# tab stretched to fill the strip, which parked the "+" hard against the menu
# button; T202 stopped the stretch and the "+" now TRAVELS with the last tab,
# so with one tab it sits ~260px from the LEFT. It was doubly wrong at 125%
# DPI, where the scaled button group is wide enough that 46px from the right
# edge lands INSIDE the menu button - the "+" click opened the menu and no tab
# ever appeared.
#
# T256 replaced it with a re-implementation of `tab_strip_layout`'s tab SIZING,
# which broke the same way one rule change later: T235 made a tab's width its
# measured TITLE plus padding, so the modelled "equal share, capped at 200 DIP"
# width was ~250px against a real ~344px tab and the click landed back inside
# tab 1. T257 then measured the run off a capture instead, and kept a private
# copy of the "+"'s own rule - `min(tabsRight + group_gap, plus_limit)` - which
# is still a second implementation of a layout the product owns.
#
