# T1194 acceptance: the in-app update, all the way through msiexec SUCCEEDING.
#
# T1178's harness (test\win32\update-apply.ps1) drives the whole update path
# against canned feeds and a canned "package", and stops one inch short on
# purpose: it runs msiexec against a package msiexec REJECTS, because a real
# install would replace the user's Ghoztty. So "the new version is actually on
# disk afterwards" was the one claim nothing could make.
#
# This closes it, with two REAL published releases and no rebuild:
#
#   * `scripts\msi-test-identity.ps1` rewrites each published
#     `Ghoztty-<v>-x64.msi` into a throwaway product - its own ProductCode,
#     UpgradeCode, install directory, component GUIDs, registry key and Start
#     Menu name. The payload, the sequences and the custom actions are the
#     published ones; only the identity moves. Installing it therefore lands
#     in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GhozttyT1194Test and cannot upgrade, remove
#     or refcount anything belonging to the user's Ghoztty.
#   * The older release is installed for real. The app is then pointed at a
#     canned feed offering the newer release, and downloads and stages it the
#     way it would from GitHub. The applier is armed exactly as `arm()` arms
#     it - a copy of the exe in the staging directory, the spec in
#     GHOZTTY_UPDATE_APPLY - and msiexec is expected to exit 0.
#
# What is deliberately NOT driven here: the tray balloon click and the "Install
# and Restart" confirmation. Those are two mouse events in front of
# `applyStagedUpdate`, and update-apply.ps1 already covers the shape on the
# other side of them. Everything from the staged package onward is real.
#
# Sections:
#   A  packages: the published MSIs, rewritten to a throwaway identity
#   B  install the older release for real (msiexec exit 0)
#   C  the app finds the newer release and stages its package
#   D  the applier installs it (msiexec exit 0) and the version moves
#   E  nothing is left behind, and the user's Ghoztty was never touched
# preflight: none - the binaries here come out of a PUBLISHED MSI, so they are
# release builds by definition and `Assert-GhozttyIsolatedBuild` would refuse
# them. The isolation is bought a different way: `-ReleaseSandbox` below gives
# the run its own pipe, its own agent lineage and its own LOCALAPPDATA, and the
# product itself is a throwaway identity installed in its own directory, which
# section E measures against the user's install on every run.
