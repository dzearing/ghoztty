# T1276 acceptance: the reconnect ladder on the RELAY path - the path a user's
# second machine actually uses.
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG. T366 built the ladder: a cross-machine window whose agent
# dies re-dials on a 1/2/4/8/15s schedule, comes back on its own when the
# machine does, and only ever reports a TERMINAL verdict for something retrying
# cannot fix. On the relay path none of that ran. About three seconds after the
# far agent died, `+list --json` reported
# `{"state":"disconnected","self_healable":false}` - the terminal verdict - and
# the relay never saw a second dial. The cause was not the network and not the
# 401 rule everyone suspected: `RemoteReconnect.startAttempt` resolved the relay
# bearer from the account/env store ONLY, and a window opened by
# `+new-remote-window --token=...` records no credential there, so the first
# attempt died at "needs a relay credential (signed out)" before a socket was
# opened. `Window.RemoteMachine.relay` now carries the bearer the window was
# dialed with, and `remote_reconnect.chooseRelayToken` prefers the renewable
# store token with that one as the fallback.
#
# The arms, in the order they are scored:
#
#   A  CONTROL. A relay window comes up through a loopback fake relay onto a
#      real `ghoztty-agent --listen`, and `+list --json` says `connected`.
#      Scored first and deliberately: every arm below reads that same field, and
#      a build that could not open a relay window at all would leave a window
#      that is "not connected" too.
#   B  LADDER. The relay goes away under the window - the machine is fine, the
#      path to it is not, which is the case the ladder exists for. The window
#      must CLIMB (`reconnecting`, rising attempt) and must really DIAL: the app
#      log has to name more than one failed re-dial. The dial count is the
#      load-bearing half, because the state field alone cannot tell a ladder
#      that is dialing from one that merely says it is - and "says it is, then
#      goes terminal without dialing" is precisely the defect.
#   C  RECOVERY. The relay comes back inside the fast ladder's ~30s budget, with
#      the far agent (and its session) untouched. The window must return to
#      `connected` ON ITS OWN, with no click, and hold the SAME session id - a
#      window rebuilt with a fresh shell is byte-identical to a recovered one
#      for anything that only reads the state.
#   D  A REJECTED BEARER IS STILL TERMINAL. The relay is told to answer 401 and
#      the link is dropped again. One attempt, then
#      `disconnected`/`self_healable:false`, and exactly ONE re-dial - and that
#      one logged as `WebSocketUnauthorized`: retrying cannot sign anyone in,
#      and the fix for the offline case must not have weakened that.
#
# Why the drop is a RELAY outage rather than the agent being killed: an agent
# that is killed and restarted comes back owning nothing, and the automatic
# ladder answers a vanished session by going terminal ON PURPOSE (T611 - a grid
# the user arranged is not replaced with empty shells unless they asked). That
# path is `remote-reconnect-fresh.ps1`'s. Here the session must survive, so the
# thing that goes away is the path to it.
#
# TEETH-CHECK: re-run with `-TeethCheck`, which never brings the relay back -
# arm C ("it comes back on its own") must go red, which is what says C is
# measuring a recovery rather than a window that never left `connected`.
# Measured 2026-09-02: C red, and D red behind it, because a window that never
# recovered has nothing left to drop - a cascade, not three findings.
#
# The credential defect's OWN negative control cannot be built harness-side: it
# lives in what the window recorded at open time. It is the pre-fix binary, and
# it was measured rather than reasoned about - at cdf47065c this same walk gave
# `{"state":"disconnected","self_healable":false}` three seconds after the agent
# died, with ONE line in the relay's request log (the original dial) and
# `remote reconnect: 'relwin' needs a relay credential (signed out)` in the app
# log. Arm B's dial count and its signed-out check are both aimed at exactly
# that reading.
