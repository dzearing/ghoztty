# T532 - a restored pane must be LIVE, never a photograph of one.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
#
# On 2026-08-06 a user hard-killed the app, relaunched, and got windows that
# painted perfectly and were dead: typing did nothing, no new output ever
# arrived, and the app logged success at every step. Two existing scripts
# already kill the app the same way and probe liveness afterwards
# (session-reattach.ps1 F8b, session-snapshot-reattach.ps1 C6d) and both restore
# live - so the freeze needed a variable neither of them had. This script owns
# the two that were run down, and the second one is the bug.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#
#   A-C: the ALTERNATE SCREEN. The incident's panes were a TUI, and an
#   alt-screen session takes a genuinely different branch of the agent's ATTACH,
#
#       const skip_replay = want_snapshot and s.gridOnAltScreen();  server.zig
#
#   where the raw ring replay is SUPPRESSED and the grid snapshot stands alone.
#   Every other persistence fixture runs cmd.exe on the primary screen, so that
#   branch was unexecuted code on the one journey a user actually took. Here a
#   `-e` fixture enters the alternate screen and echoes every line it reads:
#
#     A. Prove it IS on the alt screen (the manifest snapshot carries `?1049h`,
#        which the formatter emits only for a differing mode) and that it is
#        interactive BEFORE the kill - the positive control, without which a
#        dead pane afterwards proves only that the fixture never worked.
#     B. Hard-kill ONLY the app (Stop-Process -Force, the shape the upgrade
#        script uses). The agent keeps the ConPTY.
#     C. Relaunch, confirm the delta attach in the app's own log, confirm the
#        pre-kill screen came back - and then TYPE. The fixture answers
#        `ALTECHO<token>`, which nothing but the live child can produce: ConPTY
#        echoes the typed token itself, so matching the bare token would score a
#        frozen pane as live. (This restores live at HEAD and did before the
#        fix too - the alt screen was eliminated as the cause, not confirmed.)
#
#   D: the STALE RESUME POINT - the actual root cause. The client arms its
#   section-7.3 discard watermark from the offset its own manifest recorded,
#   and used to never compare it against the agent's stream head. A session id outlives its
#   byte stream (an agent restart relaunches the session under the same id with
#   a fresh stream at 0), so a manifest written before that restart records an
#   offset in a stream that no longer exists. Arming it discards every byte the
#   agent will ever send - its grid snapshot included - forever, while the pane
#   still paints (the viewer replays its OWN persisted snapshot) and input still
#   reaches the child. That is the report word for word: "repaint correctly but
#   non interactive, not painting, but seemed to still be working."
#
#   Section D reproduces it exactly, by rewriting the recorded offset in the
#   on-disk manifest to a phantom 43394044 - the incident's own number - while
#   the app is dead, then relaunching. Before the fix the pane comes back
#   painted and frozen; after it, the client clamps its resume point to the
#   agent's head, says so in the log, and the pane is live.
#
# Non-interactive; exits nonzero on any failure. Hermetic exactly like its two
# neighbours: a per-run %LOCALAPPDATA%, a per-run GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN, a
# private IPC pipe suffix, and it only ever kills ghoztty / ghoztty-agent
# processes launched from the repo zig-out. Runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop.
