# T297 acceptance: the Activity Monitor's DIALED (owned-connection) path.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The panel reaches a remote machine two ways, and until this
# script only one of them was proven to WORK on the box:
#
#   reuse (BORROWED)  `activity-monitor-remote.ps1` drives a panel opened from a
#                     remote window's palette, which hands it the window's own
#                     connection. Covered end to end, ownership rule included.
#   dial (OWNED)      the chooser's Activity button. `chooser-menu.ps1` proves
#                     only that the button ATTEMPTS a dial and FAILS HONESTLY
#                     against a fake directory that is not an agent endpoint.
#                     Nothing exercised dial -> sample -> free.
#
# The dial is the riskier half, because it is the only path that OWNS what it
# opens: `close` frees a transport, `shutdown()`-before-join has to unblock a
# parked RPC, and a dial landing AFTER its panel closed has to be torn down by
# `ActivityMonitor.onDialed` instead of adopted under whatever is there now.
# Each of those is a leak or a use-after-free when it is wrong, and all of them
# were argued from code reading plus a unit test of `panelMatches`.
#
# THE FIXTURE. `lib\FakeRelay.ps1` is the piece `chooser-menu.ps1` could not
# have: a loopback relay that answers `/v1/client/devices` AND upgrades
# `/v1/client/connect?device=` to a WebSocket bridged to a real
# `ghoztty-agent --listen 127.0.0.1:<port>`. `relay_dial` takes an `http://`
# base as plaintext `ws://` for exactly this, so no TLS is involved. The device
# in the directory therefore IS a reachable machine, which is what turns
# chooser-menu's honest failure into a success case.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   A  the Activity button DIALS (never borrows), the dial crosses the relay,
#      it connects, and the panel then samples the AGENT rather than this
#      process
#   B  closing that panel FREES the connection: the relay sees the client go
#      away and the app is left holding no socket to the machine
#   C  a panel closed WHILE its dial is in flight neither crashes nor leaks -
#      the late dial lands on the app's message window, is torn down instead of
#      adopted, and the relay sees that bridge close too
#   D  (T329) and it frees NOTHING ELSE: with a live remote WINDOW on the same
#      machine, the panel still dials its own link beside the window's, and
#      closing it leaves that window's session round-tripping
#
# WHY D IS A SEPARATE SECTION. A-C measure the dial with nothing else on the
# machine, which states only half the ownership rule. "The panel frees what it
# owns" is the half a leak breaks; "and nothing that it does not" is the half a
# CRASH breaks, and it cannot be wrong about anything until something else holds
# a connection to the same machine. `activity-monitor-remote.ps1` asserts that
# second half for the BORROWED panel (closing it must not take the window's
# shell down); D is the same claim on the OWNED path, where it can fail the
# other way round - a panel that frees the WINDOW's transport instead of its
# own, or one that quietly borrowed when this entry is defined by dialing
# (`activity_dial.zig`: `borrowFromWindow` is deliberately not wired to this
# button).
#
# THE ORACLE FOR A. A loopback agent enumerates the same box, so "the table
# populated" proves nothing: a panel that silently sampled THIS process would
# paint an identical-looking table under the machine's name. The distinguishing
# field is the snapshot's ROOT PID - the agent's own pid for a remote sample,
# the app's for a local one - logged by `ActivityMonitor.rebuild` as `root=`.
# `-NegativeControl` inverts it (asserting the panel sampled LOCALLY); that run
# MUST fail.
#
# THE ORACLE FOR B AND C is the app's ESTABLISHED sockets, counted from outside
# the process by `Get-NetTCPConnection`: a panel that only THOUGHT it freed its
# transport still holds one. That is deliberately not the app's account of
# itself, because "we freed it" is what a leak also says.
#
# The relay's log is the second oracle, and it answers only for C. A freed
# WsClient sends a plain TCP FIN and no WS close frame — deliberate, and the
# T81 panic is why (`ws_client.closeImpl`) — and `FakeRelay`'s pump only ever
# reads a bridge when `NetworkStream.DataAvailable` is true, which is
# `Socket.Available != 0` and therefore FALSE at a bare EOF. So the relay
# NOTICES a dial it had already pushed bytes through (C: the late bridge is
# torn down within a frame of coming up) and does NOT notice an idle one going
# away (B), exactly as its own header says it leaks idle pairs. Asserting a
# `BRIDGE down` for B would be asserting a property of the fake.
