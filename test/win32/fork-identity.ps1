# T956 acceptance - Stage 0 of the upstream pull plan: the fork-identity overlay.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\fork-identity.ps1
#
# Non-interactive. Launches no Ghoztty and touches no user state: the subject is
# a text-rewriting script, so this reads the repo and does all of its writing
# inside throwaway trees under $env:TEMP.
#
# isolation: none - no ghoztty binary is run and no CLI verb is invoked; the
# only executable this script starts is git (T680 meta-check reads this marker).
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#
# T879 measured that 52 of the 131 merge-risk files carry a fork delta of ten
# lines or fewer, almost all of it mechanical - a branding string, an apprt enum
# arm, a binary name. scripts\fork-identity.ps1 is that overlay written down, so
# a U-file merge becomes "take theirs, run apply, run check" instead of 52 hand
# resolutions repeated at every stage.
#
# A rewriting script is exactly the kind of tool that is easy to believe and
# hard to trust, so every section here is an assertion about BEHAVIOUR:
#
# A - `check` is clean on this repo. The tree already carries the identity, so
#     any finding here is a false positive in a rule, and false positives are
#     how a verifier stops being read.
# B - `apply` is a no-op on a tree that is already overlaid, through the REAL
#     write path rather than -DryRun. Idempotence is what makes it safe to run
#     the overlay again after every future merge stage.
# C - the measurement, from the fork point. The 52 U-files are re-derived from
#     the plan's own appendix, checked out at 063ac3ecc, overlaid, and compared
#     against HEAD. The number this reports is the honest version of the plan's
#     claim: how many of the 52 the script really does resolve on its own, and
#     which files still need a human. The baseline it is asserted against is
#     per-file rather than a count (T1134), so absorbing main cannot turn a
#     working overlay red - see $ReproManifestRelative below - and C8 proves on
#     every run that a mis-spelled rule still can.
# D - the negative control. Every rule is fired at a fixture carrying the
#     upstream form; a rule that silently stopped matching would otherwise pass
#     A and B forever, because both of those are assertions that nothing
#     happened.
# E - the safety control, which is the half that matters most. A blanket
#     ghostty -> ghoztty rename would pass D. This fixture carries the strings
#     that must SURVIVE - the TERM value, the GHOSTTY_* variable names,
#     upstream's repository URL, the config directory path, the Xcode module
#     name, a .none arm in a switch that is not on app_runtime, and one that is
#     but already has its own .win32 arm - and asserts the tree comes back
#     byte-identical.

# The reproduction baseline is a PER-FILE MANIFEST, not a count (T1134).
#
# It used to be `$ReproBaseline = 28` - "at least 28 of the 52 U-files come back
# byte-identical". That asserts the right thing about a rule and the wrong thing
# about the tree: every real edit that lands on a U-file, ours or one arriving
# through the daily main intake, makes that file irreproducible from a
# 2026-05-07 tree, so the number only ever falls. T1073's main merge added 45
# lines to HACKING.md and took it from 28 to 27; three consecutive turns then
# committed under `-NoGuardDue` past a red that meant nothing was wrong. A check
# that can only go red is a check people learn to skip.
#
# The manifest separates the two questions that one number was answering:
#
#   REGRESSION (asserted, C4) - a file recorded as reproducing, whose HEAD blob
#     has NOT changed since it was recorded, must still reproduce. That is a
#     rule question, and it does not decay: absorbing main cannot move it.
#   DRIFT (reported, never asserted) - a recorded file whose HEAD blob HAS
#     changed and no longer reproduces has acquired real work. That is the
#     tree's business, not the overlay's, so it is a line of output and a
#     manifest entry that ages out on the next green run.
#
# What a drifted file loses is only the exact-bytes check; it stays covered by A
# (the overlay reports nothing on it at HEAD) and C5 (the overlay leaves no
# findings on it from the fork point). What C8 protects is the manifest's teeth:
# a deliberately mis-spelled rule is proved, every run, to make C4 red.
