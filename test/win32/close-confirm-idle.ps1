# T41 acceptance: the close confirmation is skipped when the pane's shell is
# IDLE, and still shown when something is running under it.
#
# Why the product change exists: the core decides "a process is still running"
# from `cursorIsAtPrompt`, which is fed by the shell's OSC 133 semantic prompt
# marks. cmd.exe and stock PowerShell emit none, so on Windows the answer was
# ALWAYS "running" - closing a tab that was just cmd.exe sitting at a prompt
# asked for confirmation every time. The Windows-native tiebreaker is the
# process table: a shell with no descendants has nothing to lose.
#
# Both backends are covered, because the user runs the one this script would
# otherwise miss:
#
#   Section A - session-persistence OFF: the pane's shell is a direct child of
#     ghoztty.exe (the `exec` termio backend).
#   Section B - session-persistence ON (the DEFAULT): the shell runs under
#     ghoztty-agent.exe and the app only knows the pid the agent reports (the
#     `remote` backend, local connection). A fix that only handles `exec`
#     leaves every real user pane confirming.
#   Section C - a CROSS-MACHINE pane, dialed over TCP to a listening
#     ghoztty-agent. Here the app has no pid it may walk at all: the shell's pid
#     indexes the far machine's process table, so `Surface.shellPid` returns 0 by
#     design. The BUSY answer comes from the machine that owns the process
#     (T356): the agent samples its own table each second and pushes
#     `META{has_descendants}` on change, which the app reads synchronously at
#     close time. The agent here listens on loopback, so the same Win32_Process
#     oracle still works.
#
#     Its IDLE case is the one T1390 reversed. An idle cross-machine pane used
#     to close with no dialog, like an idle local one; it now confirms, because
#     ending a process on another machine is not the recoverable thing an idle
#     local shell is - and the confirmation offers Disconnect. Section A is the
#     discriminator: the same chord on a LOCAL idle pane still closes silently.
#
#   Section D - `confirm-close-surface = always` (T357). The user asked for a
#     confirmation unconditionally, so the shell's state is not a question we
#     get to ask: `Surface.shellIsIdle` answers FALSE on that config before it
#     ever looks at the process table, and an IDLE shell must still confirm.
#   Section E - a READ-ONLY surface (T357). Same shape, different forced
#     branch: a pane the user has marked read-only confirms whatever the
#     process table says.
#
# Sections A-C prove a dialog can be ABSENT; D and E prove it is still there
# where it was never the shell's call. That pairing is the point: until T41
# every close confirmed, so a regression in the forced branches was invisible,
# and now the absence of a dialog is a normal outcome - a bug that suppressed
# `always` or read-only would look exactly like the feature working.
#
# Sections A-C run the same two cases in ONE window, busy first:
#
#   1. BUSY (`ping -n 100 127.0.0.1` running) + ctrl+w -> the confirm dialog
#      appears. This is also the POSITIVE CONTROL for case 2: it proves the
#      chord reaches the app in this window, so "no dialog" below cannot be
#      "no keystroke". Escape cancels it.
#   2. IDLE (ping stopped, shell back at its prompt) + the SAME chord -> no
#      dialog, and the window actually closes. Both halves are asserted: a
#      swallowed chord also produces no dialog.
#
# Independent oracle for the busy/idle state itself: the shell's descendants
# read straight out of Win32_Process, never from anything the app says. The
# pane's shell pid comes from `ghoztty +list --json`, and is asserted to name a
# LIVE process - on Windows the agent used to report the child's HANDLE value
# there, a number that is a pid in no process at all.
#
# Each section also runs `+list --pid=<a process inside the pane>`, the same
# shell pid read back through its other consumer (this is how a process finds
# its own pane, e.g. /reset-context) - it has no other on-box coverage.
#
# -NegativeControl inverts case 2's verdict (asserts the idle close DOES
# confirm), so a passing run proves the script discriminates.
#
# T217/T218: runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1)
# and never takes the user's foreground.
# T267: sets its own window size rather than inheriting whatever the last GUI
