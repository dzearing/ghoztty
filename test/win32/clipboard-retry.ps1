# T947/T992 acceptance: a copy issued while another process holds the clipboard
# must still land (T947), and it must claim a real owner window so the write
# cannot be overtaken mid-flight (T992).
#
# THE DEFECT. `OpenClipboard` does not queue. It fails outright while any other
# process on the desktop holds the clipboard, and something routinely does for a
# few milliseconds after a copy - the copying app itself, Explorer, a
# clipboard-history service, an RDP clipboard bridge. Both clipboard call sites
# in `Surface.zig` took a single attempt and gave up, so the user's copy (or
# paste) silently did nothing, at random, with no message. `clipboard_open.open`
# (eight attempts, 15ms apart) is the fix; this script is what proves the retry
# is actually in the terminal's path rather than merely present in the tree.
#
# HOW A COPY IS ISSUED WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GUI. OSC 52 is the terminal escape
# for "put this on the clipboard", and it lands on the same `Surface.setClipboard`
# the copy keybinding does. ConPTY passes it through, so a command run IN the
# pane can perform a real copy - no desktop, no SendInput, no selection. That is
# the whole reason this script is headless and cheap enough to gate on.
#
# THE FOUR ARMS, and why each is needed:
#
#   A  ORACLE SENSITIVITY (the negative control). A hold far LONGER than the
#      retry budget must produce a LOST copy - the token never reaches the
#      clipboard, and the app says so on stderr. Without this arm, arm B could
#      pass because the harness cannot create the condition at all, which is the
#      classic way a retry test proves nothing.
#   B  THE FIX. A hold SHORTER than the budget, repeated so that a single
#      attempt would lose most of the time (45ms held, 25ms free), must not cost
#      a single copy: every one of eight tokens lands. The numbers are worked
#      out at the arm itself - the retry wins deterministically, and eight
#      single attempts surviving the same churn is a 1-in-3500 accident.
#   C  NO SINGLE-ATTEMPT OPEN LEFT. The source guard that keeps the next
#      clipboard call site from reintroducing the bug - `w32.OpenClipboard`
#      appears only inside `clipboard_open.zig`. This is also what covers the
#      PASTE site, whose behavior belongs to clipboard-paste.ps1 (it needs real
#      ctrl+v on a desktop) but whose retry is the same one line. C3 keeps the
#      owner-window registration in `App.init` for the same reason: the arm
#      below can only measure it while something still calls it.
#   D  THE COPY CLAIMS A WINDOW (T992). A retried open is still not an ATOMIC
#      write: only naming a real owner window keeps another process out between
#      our EmptyClipboard and our SetClipboardData. Read back from
#      `GetClipboardOwner`, with the null-owner shape reproduced first so the
#      oracle is proven able to tell the two apart.
#
# THE CLIPBOARD IS NOT ISOLATABLE. It is one machine-wide resource scoped to the
# window station, so unlike the IPC endpoint it cannot be given a private twin:
# this script necessarily writes the real clipboard. It saves the user's text
# first and puts it back at the end, and it never runs longer than a few seconds
# with the clipboard held.
#
# Non-interactive; asserts and exits nonzero on any failure. Private IPC
# endpoint (T441). Only ever kills ghoztty processes launched from this repo's
# zig-out.
