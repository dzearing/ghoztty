# T73 acceptance: split divider lines honor `split-divider-color`.
# T94 acceptance (run 2 tail): the divider grab band is ~9 DIP wide - it
# extends ~4.5 DIP each side of the line, over the pane surfaces, which the
# panes' WM_NCHITTEST/HTTRANSPARENT fall-through makes reachable - and a drag
# starting 4 DIP off the line still resizes.
# T155 acceptance (tail): exactly ONE divider band, a solid fill, after drags
# and after repeated small window resizes.
# T734 acceptance (T155 section): the CROSS-PANE scan T228 had to retire - a
# full scanline across both panes crosses the divider color once - restored on
# the composited capture T778 built.
# T233 acceptance (run 2 tail): the band is 2 DIP (never one physical pixel),
# and hover/drag is a COLOR change - asserted as a pair of probes that must
# read differently in the two states, not as a cursor shape.
# T251 acceptance (own run): a deliberately terrible `split-divider-color`
# (#0a0a0a on a black terminal) still paints a band that clears the design
# system's 3:1 chrome floor, in BOTH the rest and the hovered state - measured
# as WCAG contrast against the pane background, not as "some other color".
#
# T252 acceptance (run 1): the live re-color is asserted by TWO oracles, and
# the second one is why the section changed. The pixel proves the new color
# reached the capture; it does not prove OUR code asked for it - measured
# 2026-08-11, deleting onConfigChange's repaint outright left the pixel
# assertion passing. The debug-log oracle names `refreshAllDividerBands` and
# the number of bands it invalidated, so the assertion fails on a build with
# its subject removed.
#
# T765 acceptance (run 1): WHY that pixel assertion survived, measured
# 2026-09-15 - and it is not what T252 wrote down. T252 inferred "something
# else in the reload path invalidates the client area". Nothing in the reload
# path does: instrumenting every step of `onConfigChange` leaves the update
# region EMPTY at entry and after each step, and the one invalidation the
# reload makes is the divider band, consumed by `UpdateWindow` in the same
# call. The full-client repaint belongs to THIS SCRIPT: `Get-TestWindowPixels
# -Sync` is a `PrintWindow`, and a `PrintWindow` paints the whole client from
# current state before handing over the bitmap. Every pixel probe here
# repaints the thing it is about to photograph, which is why a probe taken
# after a state change cannot tell "the product asked for this repaint" from
# "the product would paint this if asked" - the general rule, and what to do
# instead, is in `docs/claude/testing.md`.
#
# So the third oracle below pins the corrected claim rather than the old one:
# the reload leaves NO update region behind. Its control is the divider-band
# line from the same reload - a reload that invalidated nothing at all would
# be a broken measurement, not a pass.
#
# paintDividerNode previously hardcoded a 0x808080 pen; it now uses the
# config color (COLORREF from Config.Color RGB), falling back to a color
# DERIVED from the terminal background when none is set (T581), and
# Window.onConfigChange invalidates the divider bands so a config
# reload re-colors live (T252: invalidate + WM_PAINT, not the GetDC shortcut -
# a color change goes through the paint cycle, see win32-design-system.md 5b).
#
# Two GUI launches (hermetic: --config-default-files=false):
#   run 1 (config file with split-divider-color = ff0000):
#         split -> a red divider pixel exists in the gap between panes;
#         then rewrite the config file to 0000ff and send ctrl+shift+,
#         (reload_config) -> the divider re-colors blue live.
#   run 2 (no color set): divider is the DERIVED fallback (T581) - the
#         terminal background darkened per Mac's formula, then lifted to the
#         3:1 chrome floor. On this harness's black terminal that lands at
#         90,89,89 (rest) and 115,114,114 (hovered); both numbers are pinned by
#         the split_geometry.zig unit tests, which own the arithmetic.
#
# T218 (batch 3): runs on a BACKGROUND Win32 desktop
# (test/win32/lib/TestDesktop.ps1), so it never takes the user's foreground -
# asserted at the end, not assumed. The private DivDrv driver is gone. Three
# mechanisms changed, and the middle one changed what this script can claim:
#
#   PIXELS. GetPixel on the composited screen is dead off the input desktop;
#   every strip now comes from PrintWindow on the TOP-LEVEL window. That suits
#   this test unusually well: the divider is GDI-painted by the parent (the
#   surviving half of the CAPTURE LIMIT), while the OpenGL panes come back as
#   a flat white fill - so a pane can no longer contribute a false
#   divider-colored pixel to a run count. It also retires the old
#   `Pane-IsOnScreen` control: a window capture cannot be occluded by another
#   window, so "is this probe looking at us?" is now "did the capture have real
#   content at all", which Get-TestDistinctColors answers.
#
#   THE CURSOR - AND THE ONE ASSERTION THAT DID NOT MIGRATE. T94's four
#   "SIZENS cursor across the band" assertions are GONE, replaced by four
#   WM_NCHITTEST probes. Measured here 2026-07-31, and it corrects the harness
#   header's old claim: `SetCursorPos` FAILS on a background desktop (it
#   requires the caller's desktop to be the input desktop) and `GetCursorPos`
#   returns -1,-1 there. The product's Window.zig WM_SETCURSOR handler is
#   coordinate-driven - WM_SETCURSOR carries no coordinates, so it must read
#   GetCursorPos - and with no readable cursor it falls straight through to
#   DefWindowProc. Measured: WM_SETCURSOR returns 0 at every point on the band.
#   Faking a cursor position is not available, so the cursor SHAPE is simply
#   not observable here.
#   What replaces it asserts strictly more about the geometry: SendMessage
#   WM_NCHITTEST to the PANE at each of the same four points and read the
#   product's own answer - HTTRANSPARENT (-1) across the band, HTCLIENT (1) at
#   the pane center. That IS the fall-through the cursor feedback rode on, read
#   at the source rather than inferred from a glyph. The band's AXIS (the
#   vertical/horizontal choice that picked SIZENS over SIZEWE) stays covered by
#   the drags, which move along it, and by the T155 section running both axes.
#   The literal glyph is not observable here and never will be.
#   T228 recovered it OFF the box instead of weakening anything on it: the
#   layout -> cursor decision is now `split_geometry.dividerCursor`, a named
#   pure function with unit tests in every lane, and `Window.zig` asserts its
#   IDC numbers against `w32.IDC_SIZEWE`/`IDC_SIZENS` in the win32 lane. What
#   is left untested is `LoadCursorW` + `SetCursor` themselves.
#
#   THE DRAG. Real SendInput drags are gone; a drag is a posted
#   down / moves / up on the TOP-LEVEL window, which is where the OS routes a
#   band click after the pane answers HTTRANSPARENT. updateDividerDrag reads the
#   coordinates out of the WM_MOUSEMOVE lparam and does not consult MK_LBUTTON
#   or the cursor, so a posted drag is the same input it would have got.
#

# T233: the band is 2 DIP, and HOVER IS A COLOR CHANGE, not just a cursor.
#
# The user, 2026-07-31: "I think the splitter lines should be 2px and have a
# hover color that emphasizes it." Before this the divider was 1 DIP - one
# physical pixel at both 100% and 125%, the two scales most users run - and
# hovering it changed only the mouse cursor, which tells nobody who is looking
# at the divider and shows up on no screenshot.
#
# A POSTED WM_MOUSEMOVE CANNOT HOLD A HOVER HERE, and that shapes the oracle.
# Measured 2026-07-31 with a debug log on both sides: a posted move at the band
# DOES set the state - the log reads `divider hover=0` - and then the OS posts
# WM_MOUSELEAVE within one frame and it reads `divider hover=null` again,
# because TrackMouseEvent watches the REAL cursor and there is none over the
# window (SetCursorPos fails off the input desktop; see the header). The band
# is back to rest before the first capture 60ms later. That is a harness
# limit, not a product defect: on a real desktop the leave arrives when the
# real pointer leaves, which is exactly the un-hover.
#
# So the claim is proved in three ways, which since T282 include the direct
# one:
#
#   * THE HOVERED COLOR - by pixels, in the hovered frame itself
#     (`Get-TestHoverCapture`, T282). The app hit-tests, sends the move,
#     repaints and captures on ONE GUI-thread stack, and a posted message is
#     only ever drained by the message loop - which is never reached in the
#     middle - so the leave described above cannot land between the move and
#     the paint. This is the assertion the two below stood in for.
#   * THE COLOR UNDER A DRAG - by pixels, mid-drag. A drag holds the same
#     `hot` state through the same paint (`paintDividers` computes ONE hot
#     color and uses it for hover and drag alike), and `dragging_split` does
#     not depend on the cursor, so it survives the leave. Kept: "the band
#     stays lit while being dragged" is its own claim (design system §5), not
#     a workaround any more.
#   * THE TRIGGER - by the debug-log oracle (the hero-mode.ps1 idiom): a move
#     onto the band sets the state and a move off it clears it. Degrades to a
#     skip on a release build, where log.debug is compiled out.
#
# Tolerance is 6, not the 40 used for "is it red or blue" - the two states are
# 25/channel apart by design, so a loose tolerance would call them equal and
# pass on a build with no hover at all.

# T155: the visible gap between panes is ONE solid divider band.
#
# The old code left a ~5 DIP gap between the panes and stroked a hairline
# down the middle of it, while the parent's WM_ERASEBKGND painted nothing -
# so every ratio change stroked a NEW line and left the OLD one on screen.
# The user's screenshot showed two parallel verticals and a 3-line stack.
#
# THE ORACLE CHANGED SHAPE IN THE MIGRATION, and this is the second thing in
# this script that a background desktop cannot express. The old version
# scanned a full scanline ACROSS both panes and counted runs, on the premise
# that a stale line under a pane has been overpainted by that pane and so
# cannot be counted. That premise is a COMPOSITED-SCREEN fact, and there is no
# composite here: measured 2026-07-31, a PrintWindow capture keeps every
# intermediate line a drag ever painted (3 drags -> 13 runs), because the GL
# child does not overpaint the parent's backing store in that render. A
# full-window repaint does not clear them either. Scored that way the test
# fails against a healthy product, for pixels no user can see.
#
# So the scan is now confined to what IS parent-visible: the strip between the
# two pane rects. That still states the fix exactly, and arguably better:
#
#   * the gap must BE the band (pane rects abut it) - `gap == bandPx`, which
#     is the geometry half and needs no pixels at all. The pre-fix ~5 DIP gap
#     fails this outright.
#   * every pixel of that gap must be divider-colored, in ONE run. A hairline
#     stroked down the middle of a wider gap reads as a run narrower than the
#     gap; a surviving stale line inside the gap reads as a second run. Those
#     are the two shapes of the reported bug.
#
# What is NOT covered any more is a stale line that ends up UNDER a pane. On
# screen the pane covers it, so it is invisible - which is why it was only ever
# a proxy - but it was a proxy with margin.
#
# T228 re-measured that margin and put back the half a background desktop CAN
# express. The other half is not recoverable and, on the evidence, is not a
# defect to recover: a healthy product genuinely leaves those pixels in the
# parent's backing store (the parent never erases, and only ever repaints the
# band region), which is exactly why the capture showed 13 runs against a
# working build. Scoring them needs a composite the parent is not part of.
# So the two additions here are the parts that stand on their own:
#
#   * the band is solid at THREE points along its length, not one. The old
#     scan crossed the band once; a band painted only where the last drag
#     repainted it reads as solid at the midpoint.
#   * the panes tile the split across the other axis, so the gap is the ONLY
#     parent-visible strip there is. That is the invariant that makes an
#     under-pane stale line unreachable on screen, measured on the live layout
#     instead of assumed - `split_geometry`'s `axis()` tests assert the same
#     tiling in pure arithmetic, and this asserts the layout code that uses it.
#
# The pixel-perfect version wanted a COMPOSITED capture, and T275 did not supply
# one: route 0 (`capture-pane`) has one pane's renderer read back its own
# offscreen target, so it answers "what is this pane showing" exactly and can
# say nothing about the strip of PARENT between two panes.
#
# T778 SUPPLIES IT, and the wide scan is back (`Measure-CrossPaneRuns` below).
# `lib\WindowComposite.ps1` draws the parent capture and then each pane's own
# capture over its own rect - the placement comes from the capture response
# (`x`/`y`/`client_width`/`client_height`), so nothing here restates the split
# layout. In that image a stale line UNDER a pane is covered by that pane's
# glass exactly as it is on screen, and one in the parent-visible gap survives.
# Measured on box 2026-09-14, the same scanline after three drags: 12 runs on
# the raw parent capture (T228's number, against a HEALTHY build), 1 on the
# composite. Both halves of the old oracle are therefore expressible again -
# the geometry half stayed, and this is the pixel half.
#
# Green is used so no earlier run's red/blue can be mistaken for a band.

# THE CROSS-PANE SCAN, restored (T228 retired it, T778 made it expressible,
# T734 is the card for exactly this): a full scanline ACROSS both panes and the
# gap between them, on a COMPOSITED capture, must cross the divider color once.
# A stale line left under a pane is covered by that pane's glass in the
# composite exactly as the pane covers it on screen, so a second run is a line
# the user would actually see.

# `Raw` is the same scan on the un-composited parent capture, carried for the

# T495: in a 3-COLUMN layout the SECOND divider tracks the pointer 1:1.
#
# The bug: startDividerDrag captured surfaceRect() as the drag's reference
# frame, which is correct only for the ROOT split. The second divider's ratio
# belongs to the nested right-hand split, so the first motion tick mapped the
# pointer against the full width (~0.667 as the nested ratio), teleporting the
# divider from 2/3*W to ~0.778*W (~200px on the user's window), and every
# later move kept that offset - the divider sat well right of the pointer for
# the whole drag. Fixed by capturing the dragged NODE's own region
# (Window.splitRegionRect) and mapping via split_geometry.dragRatio.
#
# Oracle: pane rects, not pixels - the divider position IS the boundary
# between the panes on either side of it, and a teleport moves that boundary
# ~10% of the window width instead of the distance the pointer traveled.
