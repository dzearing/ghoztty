# T142 acceptance: the layered overlays defend their z-order.
#
# Every win32 overlay (banner strip, dim overlay, themed scrollbar, resize
# overlay) is a WS_POPUP owned by the pane/window it decorates, so Windows
# keeps it above its OWNER for free - and says nothing about the windows in
# between. Two ways it ends up over other applications, both permanent
# because every reposition used to pass SWP_NOZORDER:
#   1. a stray WS_EX_TOPMOST (we never set it; a T131 verification probe did
#      and never put it back - the filed cause of this task);
#   2. simply being SHOWN while its window is not in front, since
#      SWP_SHOWWINDOW lifts a popup to the top of the non-topmost band.
# Either way the user sees "windows in the background have banners that
# overlap windows in the foreground".
#
# T224/T272: runs on the BACKGROUND test desktop (lib\TestDesktop.ps1), so it
# never steals the user's foreground.
#
# ACTIVATION, on the test desktop. The whole oracle used to be expressed
# against GetForegroundWindow, and a background desktop has NO foreground
# window - it returns 0 for every window. The stand-in is the ACTIVE window
# (GetGUIThreadInfo.hwndActive, `Get-TestActiveWindow`), and T224 MEASURED
# that it is faithful for this claim before a line was ported:
#
#   - Focus-TestWindow really does raise the window inside the non-topmost
#     band, exactly as a real activation does. With oz2 active the indices
#     read ov=2 A=4 B=1; activating oz1 instead reads A above B. Reproduced
#     across two runs.
#   - It really does deliver WM_ACTIVATE to the app: an injected stray
#     topmost heals on activation alone, with no layout event, and the only
#     caller of Window.healOverlayZOrders in the whole tree is the
#     WM_ACTIVATE handler (Window.zig). So section D is portable, not
#     approximated.
#   - Its BOOLEAN RETURN is not the activation oracle. Called without
#     -Child it returns False on a ghoztty window, because the app moves
#     keyboard focus to the GhozttyTerminal child, so GetFocus() is never the
#     top-level. Gating an abort on that return (which is what the old
#     GrabForeground gate became) would have aborted every run with no
#     verdict. This script gates on Get-TestActiveWindow instead.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT REPRODUCE HERE, named rather than quietly weakened:
#
#   - The SANDWICH is no longer the section-B repro. Measured: topmosting the
#     overlay also raises its OWNER to the top of the band, unopposed on a
#     desktop where no window holds the foreground, so nothing foreign lands
#     between the overlay and its owner - Sandwich reads "0:" in the healthy
#     AND the injected state. It stays as a healthy-state invariant (A/C);
#     the defect is caught by the two measures that DID discriminate: the
#     overlay's z-index against the ACTIVE window (healthy 2 > 1, injected
#     0 < 4) and WindowFromPoint over the banner band (healthy: oz2's
#     terminal; injected: GhozttyBannerOverlay). Both statements hold on the
#     interactive desktop too, so -Interactive scores the same assertions.
#   - The SWP_SHOWWINDOW LIFT - section A's original discovery - does not
#     reproduce off the input desktop. Measured: hiding the overlay and
#     re-showing it with SWP_SHOWWINDOW|SWP_NOZORDER (the product's own
#     flags) put it back at the SAME index, still below the active window,
#     where on the input desktop it went to the top of the band. So section A
#     is a healthy-state baseline here and nothing more; the stray-bit half
#     is what carries the repro.
#
# No pixels: WindowFromPoint respects z-order and sees layered popups, which
# is what "is the banner in front here?" needs, and there is no composited
# screen off the input desktop to sample anyway (CAPTURE LIMIT).
#
# Oracles (z-order is read as an index into the EnumWindows top-down
# enumeration, so "above" and "below" are measured, not inferred):
#   A. healthy: the banner overlay has no topmost bit, sits above its own
#      window, and sits BELOW the active window.
#   B. negative control: SetWindowPos(overlay, HWND_TOPMOST) reproduces the
#      filed report - the same overlay now indexes above the active window
#      and WindowFromPoint says the banner is what you see there.
#   C. a reposition heals it: bit gone, still above its own window, nothing
#      foreign sandwiched.
#   D. so does an activation change (WM_ACTIVATE), which is when the defect
#      is actually noticed - a window nobody resizes would stay broken.
#   E. a LEGITIMATE topmost owner (toggle_window_float_on_top, the quick
#      terminal) is preserved: Windows propagates the bit to owned popups,
#      and healing must not strip it or the banner would hide behind its own
#      window. This is the case that makes the fix owner-RELATIVE.
#   F. the same healing reaches the dim overlay and the scrollbar popup,
#      which share the helper.
#   G. (T180) so does the hovered-URL bubble, which T142 skipped as
#      "short-lived" - only its visibility is; the HWND outlives every hover.
#   H. (T180) the quick terminal, which topmosts ITSELF, keeps both its own
#      band and the propagated bit on its owned popup across a heal.
#   I. (T721) the find bar and the command palette - the two ACTIVATABLE
#      popups - are the end of the list, not the next entries on it: they
#      dismiss themselves the moment activation leaves them, with or without a
#      stray topmost bit, so neither T142 case can reach them and the heal
#      would be dead code. Measured, because "it probably cannot happen" is
#      what left them unchecked for a month.

    # palette - and why they close the list rather than being the next two
    # entries on it.
    #
    # T180 enumerated every WS_POPUP under src/apprt/win32 and left these two
    # alone because they differ in KIND, not because anyone had checked them.
    # They are not overlays: they carry no WS_EX_NOACTIVATE, ShowWindow(SW_SHOW)
    # ACTIVATES them, and they put keyboard focus into their own EDIT child.
    # The claim measured here is that this makes both T142 cases unreachable on
    # them, so the heal would be dead code:
    #
    #   both popups DISMISS THEMSELVES the instant they stop being the active
    #   window - the palette on WM_ACTIVATE/WA_INACTIVE, the find bar on
    #   EN_KILLFOCUS of its edit (App.zig) - so neither can ever be a
    #   BACKGROUND window's popup, which is the whole shape of the report T142
    #   came from ("windows in the background have banners that overlap windows
    #   in the foreground").
    #
    # I2 is the teeth: the popup is asserted VISIBLE first (positive control),
    # activation is then moved to another window of the same app, and it is
    # asserted GONE. The day that dismiss regresses this pair goes red - and
    # that is exactly the day these two would start needing the heal.

    # have to, because the dismiss fires regardless - so the bit only ever sits
    # on a window nobody can see. The probe un-pins its own injection, since the
    # product is not going to, and a pin left for the harness restore is scored
