# T167 acceptance: a test sandbox must be able to run its OWN local agent.
#
# THE TRAP THIS CLOSES
#
# The agent takes a per-user, per-LINEAGE single-instance guard (a named mutex),
# and the lineage is a compile-time fact: `local-debug` for every debug build on
# the box. So a debug agent already running - the one holding the loop's own
# panes, a leftover from an earlier suite - refuses every sandbox's agent with
# exit 183. The sandbox does not go red: `sharedConnection` answers null on a
# failed resolve by design, the app opens plain exec panes, and the suite goes on
# to report on "session persistence" while exercising the NON-persistent path.
# Measured 2026-07-29 building upgrade-no-fork.ps1: every sandbox run came up
# with an empty local-agent-debug\ until the box's zig-out agent was killed.
#
# `GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE=<suffix>` names a distinct lineage - guard, lock and
# heartbeat, plus the app's state dir, its agent pipe and the +sessions CLI - so
# a sandbox coexists with the box's agents instead of killing them.
#
# ARMS (each isolates exactly one variable):
#
#   A  control: TWO agents in the SAME lineage, same LOCALAPPDATA, different
#      pipes. The second must still be refused (183). Scored first: without it,
#      B proves nothing - a build that had simply removed the guard would pass
#      B and leave two daemons fighting over one pipe.
#   B  two more agents, differing from A1 ONLY in GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE, must
#      both come up and leave A1 running: three live agents, one box.
#   C  `+sessions` reads the SUFFIXED state dir - and cannot find that agent
#      with the suffix cleared, which is what proves the derivation moved.
#   D  end to end, the arm that matters: the same GUI launch, twice, differing
#      only in the value of GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE. With a suffix a live agent
#      holds it; with a suffix another agent already owns, the app comes up
#      SILENTLY non-persistent - the exact original failure, reproduced.
#
# Hermetic and considerate: private LOCALAPPDATA everywhere, an IPC pipe suffix,
# a background desktop, and it only ever kills processes IT started (by pid).
# It deliberately does NOT clear the debug lineage first - not needing to is the
# whole claim.
#
# -Release (T269): run the SAME arms against the ReleaseFast staging build in
# zig-out-release, i.e. the lineage the user's own Ghoztty is in. That is the
# configuration the guard was actually blocking - `local`, held by the installed
# agent that owns the user's live panes - and until this switch existed there was
# no way to test it: a release-lineage run either lost the race (exit 183, the
# sandbox silently non-persistent) or, with a visible stale heartbeat, would have
# TERMINATED the user's agent and every session on it. The arms are unchanged;
# only the three isolating knobs are, and they are what the run proves:
#
#   GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE  guard mutex + heartbeat + agent pipe + state dir
#   GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX     the app's own IPC endpoint
#   LOCALAPPDATA            every file the app and the agent write
#
# Release-only launch hardening, because a release build self-heals things a
# debug build does not: GHOZTTY_URL_SCHEME=0 (it would repoint the user's real
# `ghoztty://` handler at a temp exe) and GHOZTTY_PATH_SELFHEAL=0 (belt and
# braces - the install-location gate already refuses a zig-out-release exe). The
# agent autostart Run key IS written in a release build; its value name carries
# the lineage suffix, so it can never be the user's `GhozttyAgent` entry, and the
# BYSTANDER assertions below prove that plus "the user's agent is still running"
# rather than assuming either.
