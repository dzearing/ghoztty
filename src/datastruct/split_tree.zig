/// its basic state, there are no splits and it is a single full-sized
/// terminal. However, it can be split arbitrarily many times among two
/// axes (horizontal and vertical) to create a tree of terminal views.
///
/// This is an immutable tree structure, meaning all operations on it
/// will return a new tree with the operation applied. This allows us to
/// store versions of the tree in a history for easy undo/redo. To facilitate
/// this, the stored View type must implement reference counting; this is left
/// as an implementation detail of the View type.
///
/// The View type will be stored as a pointer within the tree and must
/// implement a number of functions to work properly:
///
///   - `fn ref(*View, Allocator) Allocator.Error!*View` - Increase a
///     reference count of the view. The Allocator will be the allocator provided
///     to the tree operation. This is allowed to copy the value if it wants to;
///     the returned value is expected to be a new reference (but that may
///     just be a copy).
///
///   - `fn unref(*View, Allocator) void` - Decrease the reference count of a
///     view. The Allocator will be the allocator provided to the tree
///     operation.
///
///   - `fn eql(*const View, *const View) bool` - Check if two views are equal.
///
/// Optionally the following functions can also be implemented:
///
///   - `fn splitTreeLabel(*const View) []const u8` - Return a label that is used
///     for the debug view. If this isn't specified then the node handle
///     will be used.
///
/// Note: for both the ref and unref functions, the allocator is optional.
/// If the functions take less arguments, then the allocator will not be
/// passed.
