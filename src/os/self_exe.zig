//! Our own executable path, for the callers whose very next move is to LAUNCH
//! it: the ConPTY holder (`--pty-host`), the relaunch guard, the auto-launched
//! second instance, the agent re-registering its own command line.
//!
//! Those callers all reach for `std.fs.selfExePath`, and inside a TEST binary
//! that answer is a trap. "Our own executable" is then `ghoztty-agent-test.exe`
//! or `ghostty-test.exe` — a zig TEST RUNNER, not the product — so spawning it
//! does not start a holder, a guard or an app. It starts a copy of the test
//! suite, detached, and (because every one of these spawns deliberately escapes
//! the caller's kill-on-close job, which is the point of them) OUTSIDE anything
//! that would take it down with the lane that made it.
//!
//! Measured (T933, 2026-08-19): the agent lane's `PtySpawner` test spawned
//! `ghoztty-agent-test.exe --pty-host --spec …` through the shell-parent hop,
//! reparented to explorer.exe. That copy panics on the unrecognized argument
//! and usually dies in ~3s — but nothing waits for it, and the copies that do
//! NOT die quickly are what turned a 17.6-minute floor run into 61 minutes of
//! wall clock: test binaries alive 40+ minutes after their lane printed PASS,
//! burning a core each and hosting a tree of `msedgewebview2.exe` children. A
//! self-spawn whose argv the runner happens to ACCEPT is worse still: no args
//! at all runs the whole suite again (which re-runs the spawn), and the build
//! runner's own `--listen=-` leaves a copy blocked on a pipe forever.
//!
//! So the rule is structural rather than remembered: a test build has no
//! product exe to launch, and asking for one is an error every caller already
//! knows how to handle — they fall back, degrade or skip exactly as they do
//! when the spawn itself fails. Nothing here changes what the product does;
//! `builtin.is_test` is false in every shipped binary.
//!
//! Use `std.fs.selfExePath` directly when the path is being READ rather than
//! launched (locating a sibling resource, naming ourselves in a log, comparing
//! install lineage) — a test binary's answer is perfectly good for that.
