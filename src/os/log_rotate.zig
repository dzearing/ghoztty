//! Bounding the shared Windows log sink
//! (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\ghoztty.log`).
//!
//! That file is the ONLY diagnostic surface a release build leaves behind (the
//! GUI subsystem has no console), and it is appended to by the GUI app, the
//! agent and every one-shot `ghoztty +…` CLI invocation — several a second on a
//! box driving Ghoztty from scripts. Until T410 nothing ever bounded it: it was
//! 9.4 MB on this box with no rotation and no cap, so the file a user would be
//! asked to send back grows without limit, and the only way it ever got smaller
//! was somebody deleting it by hand.
//!
//! So the writer keeps at most TWO generations — the live `ghoztty.log` and one
//! `ghoztty.log.1` — each bounded by `max_bytes`. That is a pair a user can zip
//! and a window of history long enough to hold an incident.
//!
//! ## Why the rename goes through the HANDLE and not the path
//!
//! Rotation is decided independently by every writer, so two processes can both
//! cross the threshold in the same millisecond. A path rename (`dir.rename`) is
//! then a real hazard: the first renames `ghoztty.log` to `.log.1`, a third
//! writer immediately creates a fresh (tiny) `ghoztty.log`, and the second's
//! rename moves THAT over the archive — the whole history dropped by the
//! mechanism that exists to preserve it.
//!
//! Renaming by handle removes the race rather than narrowing it. The handle
//! names a file OBJECT, not a path, so the second writer renames the very file
//! the first one already renamed: `.log.1` → `.log.1`, which succeeds and
//! changes nothing. A writer that opened after the rotation opens the fresh
//! file, sees a small size on its own handle, and does not rotate at all.
//!
//! The other half of the arrangement is on the append side: every writer opens
//! the sink with the default share mode, which includes `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`, so
//! the rename is legal while other processes hold the file open. Their handles
//! follow the renamed file for the microseconds until their next log line, when
//! they reopen the path and land on the new live file.
