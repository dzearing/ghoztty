// The RichEdit this replaces answered `caret()`, `lineCount()` and a text read
// on the same stack the caller was on. A WebView2 cannot: everything crosses
// the process boundary asynchronously. So the direction of truth is inverted -
// the PAGE owns the live document and PUSHES a snapshot up on every change,
// and native keeps the last snapshot as the thing it lays out and serializes
// from. Nothing here ever answers a question; it only reports.

//
// ## Quotes are NODES, and their identity is an attribute (T935)
//
// A quoted passage is a `<div class="q" data-qid="N">` child of the box. That
// is the whole point of the rebuild: RichEdit had no per-run user field, so
// win32 had to RECOVER a quote's identity by matching its text against
// line-aligned runs, and any edit to the passage silently orphaned its
// metadata. A DOM node carries the id itself, so deleting the block drops the
// metadata with it and editing the block keeps it.
//
// `quotes` in a snapshot is `[{id, start, end}]` over the same string `text`,
// in UTF-16 code units, in document order — the live truth the host serializes
// the report from. `quotes` in a seed is the same shape, and is how the host
// re-attaches ids to a buffer that outlived the page (a closed and reopened
// composer, a native edit): the buffer is plain text, so somebody has to say
// which runs of it are quotes, and that somebody is native exactly once, at
// seed time.
//
// `gen` is the seed's generation, echoed in every snapshot that follows it. It
// is what lets the host tell "the user typed this" from "this was measured
// before the seed that replaced it" - the two are indistinguishable by content
// and only one of them may be written back over the buffer.
//
// `caret` is in UTF-16 CODE UNITS, which is what a JS string offset is. Native
// converts it against the same buffer with `utf16_offset.zig`, because the
// pane's buffer is UTF-8 and the two agree only for ASCII (the T648 boundary,
// unchanged by this rebuild).
//
// ## Image chips are NODES too, but for a different reason (T936)
//
// A chip is a `<span class="i" data-img="N" contenteditable="false">` whose
// text is literally `[Image #N]`. Unlike a quote it needs no identity from the
// node — that text says which picture it is, which is why the host goes on
// deriving the live set from the buffer and nothing about the report, the
// carousel or `Store.live` changed. What the node buys is ATOMICITY: an inline
// non-editable element is one character to the engine, so Backspace beside it
// removes the chip whole instead of eating the `]` and leaving text that no
// longer parses — the thing `chipEndingAt` had to hand-carry, now the
// browser's.
//
// The serialization is therefore load-bearing: a chip contributes exactly its
// own text and no line break, so a document with chips in it reads back
// byte-for-byte as the buffer that seeded it.
//
// ## Ctrl+Z takes a quote or a chip back out (T983)
//
// A quote and a chip arrive as a SEED, because native cannot say "insert this
// here" — and a seed rebuilds the document, which the engine's undo stack has
// no entry for. (Nor can the page make one: in a `plaintext-only` box
// `execCommand("insertHTML")` flattens a block or a chip to its own text, so
// there is no engine command that inserts the NODES this composer is built
// from.) So a seed that stands for one user-visible edit carries `undo:true`,
// and the page keeps what it replaced on a journal of its own.
//
// Ctrl+Z then asks the engine FIRST and falls back to that journal: typing
// since the quote landed unwinds keystroke by keystroke the way it does
// everywhere else, and only once the engine has nothing left does the quote
// itself come out. The order is right for free because a rebuild leaves the
// engine's older steps unapplicable, and Chromium answers those with a no-op
// rather than with damage — which is the same fact this fallback detects: an
// undo that changed nothing is an undo the engine did not have.
//
// Ctrl+Y (and Ctrl+Shift+Z) is the same machine run backwards.
//
// ## Pictures arrive through the engine's own events
//
// `paste` and `drop` carry the picture already decoded. The composer takes it
// off the event, re-encodes anything that is not a PNG through a canvas, and
// posts the bytes up. That replaces the RichEdit path's three hand-carried
// steps — intercept Ctrl+V, ask the clipboard whether it holds a bitmap,
// swallow the `WM_CHAR` the interception left behind — with the event the
// engine was already going to fire.
