//! The notice a restored pane prints when its persisted session did NOT come
//! back and we deliberately refused to re-run what it was running (T230).
//!
//! Background: when the local agent restarts (a reboot, or the mandatory
//! agent upgrade), it materializes its recorded sessions as dead-but-
//! relaunchable tombstones. The old default was to RELAUNCH the recorded
//! command in place. The user rejected that outright, verbatim: *"We should not
//! ever re-execute the commands which were previously ran, but, the console
//! message which says the session was closed could list the previous command
//! executed so the user can choose to copy/paste it."* Re-running a recorded
//! command is unsafe as a default — it was recorded in a world that no longer
//! exists, and nobody asked for it a second time.
//!
//! So the pane comes up on a FRESH shell and prints this notice above it. This
//! module is the notice AND the terminal moves that keep it above the shell:
//! bytes in, bytes out, plus `foldIntoScrollback` / `trackFold` / `holdAbove`
//! (T423), which need a `Terminal` but still no allocator and no I/O — so both
//! the exact text and its placement are unit-testable in the none-runtime lane
//! rather than only observable by driving a GUI.
//!
//! SANITIZING IS THE POINT, not a nicety. The command text is DATA that came
//! off a disk file written by another process, and we are about to write it
//! into a VT parser. An unsanitized `\x1b]0;pwned\x07` (or a bare `\r`, or a
//! newline that breaks the block into a fake second line) would be executed as
//! terminal control by the very pane that is supposed to be showing it inertly.
//! Every C0/C1 control byte and DEL becomes a space here, before it can mean
//! anything.
