//! Remote implements the `termio` backend for a pane whose child process lives
//! on a remote machine, reached over a `RemoteConnection` (`src/remote/`). It is
//! the remote counterpart to `Exec` (the local subprocess+pty backend) and
//! exposes the EXACT same method set `termio/backend.zig` dispatches to, but does
//! NOT own a pty or a subprocess. Instead:
//!
//!   - A shared `connection.Connection` (one per conn-key, supplied by the caller —
//!     the C-API/Surface wiring lands in increment 4b) owns the two SSH channels,
//!     the MPSC writer, and the demux reader.
//!   - This backend OPENs a new session (or ATTACHes an existing one by
//!     `session_id`) on the connection to obtain a `*connection.Pane`. The pane
//!     carries a per-channel inbound ring (`inbound_ring.Channel`, §3.4).
//!   - There is NO per-pane read thread: the connection's single demux thread reads
//!     the data channel and `pushTo`s each frame's bytes into the target pane's
//!     ring, then wakes the pane's IO thread via a `Waker`. This backend backs that
//!     `Waker` with an `xev.Async` registered on the pane's OWN IO thread/loop
//!     (`Thread.zig` / `Termio.ThreadData.loop`); the async callback drains the
//!     ring and calls `Termio.processOutput` ON THIS PANE'S THREAD — the same call
//!     Exec's `ReadThread` makes — restoring per-pane parallelism with no cross-pane
//!     head-of-line blocking.
//!   - Input (`queueWrite`) is MPSC-enqueued as `DATA` via `connection.writeInput`
//!     (the pane owns its outbound byte offset). `resize` sends a `RESIZE` control
//!     frame. Teardown `DETACH`es (keep-alive) by default, NOT `CLOSE`.
//!
//! See design §3.1 (the union seam), §3.3 (the per-method behavior map this
//! mirrors), and §3.4 (thread topology, the inbound-ring mini-spec, and the
//! use-after-free teardown invariant).
//!
//! INCREMENT 4a SCOPE: this makes libghostty COMPILE with a structurally faithful
//! `.remote` arm wired to the already-built connection. The deepest `xev.Async`
//! drain wiring is implemented; a few agent-metadata refinements are marked
//! `// TODO(wp3)` where the protocol surface for them lands in a later increment.
