//! T339: the cross-machine "Restore All" (T336) with its NETWORK off the GUI
//! thread.
//!
//! Rebuilding another machine's topology costs 1 + N relay dials — one for the
//! layout pull, then one per rebuilt window, because a win32 window OWNS its
//! transport and frees it on close (`Window.deinit`), so a shared connection
//! would die with the first window the user closed. That ownership rule is
//! T336's and stands; what was wrong is that all N+1 full WebSocket upgrades ran
//! on the GUI thread. On loopback that is milliseconds and invisible; against a
//! real rendezvous relay it is N+1 round trips with the message loop STOPPED —
//! a 6-window machine on a 300 ms link freezes the app for ~2 seconds with no
//! cursor, no paint and no way to cancel.
//!
//! So the work is split down the line that decides it:
//!
//!   worker thread   dial → GET_LAYOUTS → LIST_SESSIONS → one dial per window
//!   GUI thread      decide + `restoreWindow` per window (it creates windows)
//!
//! The pattern is the one `SessionRoster.fetch` (T295/T319) and
//! `RemoteReconnect`'s redial already use here: spawn, block off-thread,
//! `PostMessage` the result back to the app's message window (never to the
//! chooser's own — `DestroyWindow` discards a window's queued messages, and a
//! discarded reply would leak every connection it carries, the T318/T295
//! lesson).
//!
//! OWNERSHIP is the part worth stating. One `Job` allocation travels both ways:
//! the GUI thread fills in where to dial and what is already open, the worker
//! fills in what it pulled and dialed, and the GUI thread consumes it and frees
//! it. Every dial it carries is freed by `Job.destroy` unless the rebuild handed
//! it to a window first — so a reply landing after the chooser closed, after the
//! app started quitting, or on a window that failed to build cannot leak a
//! transport, and cannot hand one to a window that no longer exists.
//!
//! The per-window dials are CONCURRENT (T616). Off the GUI thread they stopped
//! blocking paint, which was T339's defect, but serially they still cost
//! `(1 + N) x RTT` before the first window appeared — the wait grew with the
//! number of windows the user was bringing back. They are independent by
//! construction (each window owns its transport for life), so they fan out
//! across a small pool and the whole restore costs about two round trips
//! whatever N is. The pool is BOUNDED because the far end is not ours: a
//! machine with 40 windows must not open 40 simultaneous WebSocket upgrades at
//! a relay that may rate-limit them.
