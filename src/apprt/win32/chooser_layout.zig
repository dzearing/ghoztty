//! Pure layout for the win32 machine chooser's master-detail shell (T175, the
//! structural half of T140).
//!
//! The chooser used to be a 440-wide single column — account row, filter, a
//! five-row list, a status sentence, then Open + Cancel. Mac's
//! `MachineChooserView` is an 840x540 master-detail chooser: an account row
//! across the top, a fixed 260-wide machine column on a faint wash at the left,
//! a detail pane at the right carrying the selected machine's identity and its
//! primary action, and a footer holding Cancel alone.
//!
//! Everything here is arithmetic on a DPI scale, so it runs in the none-runtime
//! test lane; `MachineChooser.zig` keeps the HWNDs and the GDI calls. The
//! `Rect` type is local rather than `w32.RECT` for exactly that reason.
