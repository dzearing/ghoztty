//! One warm, shared connection per REMOTE machine, borrowed by every feature
//! that needs to talk to that machine's agent (T461).
//!
//! This is the remote-side counterpart to `LocalAgent`'s warm shared connection,
//! and the win32 translation of Mac's `MachineConnectionPool.swift` (60ccd4f45).
//! The local agent has had a warm connection since session persistence shipped,
//! which is why the chooser's "This PC" row lists through one socket while every
//! remote row used to dial, read and free a fresh connection on EVERY roster
//! fetch — plus, for a relay machine, a whole WebSocket upgrade and relay
//! authentication each time. Both of the features stacked on top of that pay for
//! it: there is nowhere to hang a subscription (a per-session CPU meter needs a
//! connection that OUTLIVES one RPC, which a dial-read-free probe cannot host),
//! and a Kill's dial/free cycle armed exactly the window where the agent's push
//! pumps could outlive their connection (the T328 note in `SessionRoster.zig`).
//!
//! `machine_pool.zig` holds the RULES — the endpoint key, the lease refcount,
//! the re-dial cooldown, the generation check — and is unit-tested in the `none`
//! lane. This file is the resources: dial threads, `*Connection` handles, the
//! message hop back to the GUI thread, and the refcount that lets a blocking RPC
//! outlive the pool's own reference.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! Every method here is GUI-THREAD ONLY except `Entry.retain`/`Entry.release`,
//! which are atomic on purpose (see below). A dial blocks — TCP connect, TLS,
//! WebSocket upgrade, HELLO handshake — so it runs on a detached thread and
//! posts its outcome as `WM_APP_MACHINE_POOL_DIALED` to the APP's message-only
//! window, never to a chooser's HWND: `DestroyWindow` discards a window's queued
//! messages, and a discarded dial would leak a whole connection.
//!
//! ## The refcount is what replaces Mac's ARC retain
//!
//! A pooled connection is used for BLOCKING calls (`LIST_SESSIONS`,
//! `CLOSE_SESSION`) on worker threads, where the last lease can drop mid-call.
//! Mac keeps the connection object alive across such a call by retaining it;
//! here `Entry` carries an atomic refcount — the pool holds one reference, and
//! each `borrow` holds another until the worker gives it back. Whoever drops the
//! last one frees the transport. That is strictly stronger than Mac's rule that
//! an invalidation must be delivered synchronously so subscribers stop touching
//! the handle before the free: a win32 link-state callback arrives on the
//! connection's own reader thread and can only ever POST to the GUI thread, so
//! synchronous delivery is not available to us — and does not need to be, since
//! a borrow the notification has not reached yet is holding the connection alive
//! by construction.
//!
//! ## What the pool deliberately does not own
//!
//! The LOCAL agent. `LocalAgent` already owns exactly this for the app's
//! lifetime, and pooling it here would mean two connections to one agent.
