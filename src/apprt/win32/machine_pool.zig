//! The bookkeeping behind ONE warm connection per remote machine (T461).
//!
//! `MachineConnectionPool.zig` is the plumbing — dial threads, `*Connection`
//! handles, refcounts, the message hop back to the GUI thread. This module is
//! everything about the pool that is a RULE rather than a resource: what a
//! machine's identity is, and what taking or giving back a borrow means for it.
//!
//! It is split out for the reason Mac's `MachineConnectionPool.Ledger` is
//! (60ccd4f45): refcounting and re-dial policy are the parts that regress
//! silently. A connection freed while somebody still holds it crashes far from
//! the cause, and one that is never freed just leaks a socket per machine per
//! chooser opening — neither shows up as a failing pixel. Kept pure, both are
//! unit-testable in the `none` lane with no agent, no dial and no GUI thread.
//!
//! ## The identity key is the ENDPOINT
//!
//! Two chooser rows that name the same relay device (or the same `host:port`)
//! describe ONE agent, so they must share one connection. Keying by row — or by
//! chooser — would open a second socket to the same machine and, worse, would
//! make "is this machine warm" un-answerable from anywhere but the row that
//! dialed it. `activity_borrow.sourceId` keys the Activity Monitor's carousel
//! the same way and for the same reason; this key carries its scheme prefix as
//! well, because the pool holds both kinds at once and `relay:<base>|<device>`
//! must never collide with a `tcp:` key.
//!
//! ## Generations
//!
//! A dial blocks for as long as it takes; the machine can be released,
//! invalidated and re-dialed while one is in flight. Every state change that
//! makes an in-flight dial's result unwanted bumps the slot's generation, and a
//! landed dial is only installed when its generation still matches. The counter
//! is pool-wide and monotonic rather than per-slot, so a slot reused for the
//! same endpoint can never hand a stale dial a generation that matches by
//! accident.
