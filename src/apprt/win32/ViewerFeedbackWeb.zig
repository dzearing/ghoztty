//! The feedback composer's text surface: a second `ICoreWebView2Controller`
//! filling the pill's text rect, hosting the page in
//! `viewer_feedback_page.zig` (T934, answering D43).
//!
//! ## Why a whole second controller
//!
//! D43 asked which text control the composer should be built on and was
//! answered — against the recommendation — with "the same web view engine the
//! page beside it already uses". The reason is what a text control has to get
//! right that we would otherwise hand-carry: caret and selection, word wrap,
//! undo, the clipboard, drag and drop, IME composition for anyone writing in a
//! language that needs one, and a screen reader that can read the field back.
//! A browser engine has all of that; a control we drive by hand has whatever
//! we remembered to build.
//!
//! It is a SECOND controller rather than an overlay on the pane's own, and
//! that is not an implementation detail: chrome injected into the page would
//! have to survive arbitrary third-party CSS and z-index, and would put the
//! composer inside the very content it is reporting on. The pane's environment
//! is shared (one browser process, one user-data folder); only the controller
//! and its renderer are new.
//!
//! ## Lifetime — D43's own mitigation
//!
//! Created on the first OPEN and destroyed on CLOSE, with everything that has
//! to survive kept on the pane. That is what the decision's mitigation asked
//! for: a composer nobody has opened costs a closed pane nothing, and a
//! composer that has been closed gives its renderer back. The consequence to
//! rely on is that this object owns NO state a user would miss — the report
//! text lives in `pane.feedbackText()`, and every open re-seeds the page from
//! it.
//!
//! ## Everything here is asynchronous, and that is the shape change
//!
//! The RichEdit this replaces answered `caret()`, `lineCount()` and a text read
//! on the caller's own stack. A WebView2 answers through callbacks, so the
//! ownership flips: the PAGE owns the live document and pushes a snapshot up
//! on every edit, and this object keeps the last snapshot as the truth the bar
//! lays out from and the pane serializes from. Nothing here ever asks the page
//! a question.
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! - **Creation can still be in flight when the composer is closed again.**
//!   Every runtime callback goes through a refcounted `Token` whose back
//!   pointer is nulled on destroy, the same shape `ViewerPane.Pending` uses —
//!   a controller that completes into a dead composer is closed on the spot.
//! - **The page is not writable until it says `ready`.** Seeds and vars that
//!   arrive before that are held and flushed there, which is also what makes a
//!   page that reloaded itself heal instead of blanking the report.
