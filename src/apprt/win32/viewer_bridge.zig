//! The viewer pane's JS↔native bridge: the script win32 injects into every
//! page, and the messages that come back up it (T375, design P1/P2).
//!
//! Pure: text and JSON, no OS surface and no COM, so it is unit tested in the
//! `-Dapp-runtime=none` lane like the rest of `apprt/win32`'s pure modules.
//! `ViewerPane.zig` is the only caller — it hands `injected_js` to
//! `AddScriptToExecuteOnDocumentCreated` and `parse` whatever
//! `get_WebMessageAsJson` returns.
//!
//! ## P1 — the shared JS is WebKit-shaped, and stays that way
//!
//! `src/viewer/viewer.js` and `src/viewer/selection.js` talk to native through
//! `window.webkit.messageHandlers.viewerTOC.postMessage(obj)` because they were
//! written against a `WKWebView`. WebView2's bridge is
//! `window.chrome.webview.postMessage(obj)` + `add_WebMessageReceived`, and the
//! JSON the host reads back out of `get_WebMessageAsJson` is the same object
//! either way. So the whole translation is the ~10-line shim below and **no
//! shared JS is forked**: that file is the one part of the viewer that came
//! free with the upstream merge, and a Windows copy of it would mean every
//! future Mac viewer commit needs a Windows translation.
//!
//! ## P2 — shim and `selection.js` are ONE injected blob
//!
//! Mac's lesson is recorded at `ViewerView.swift:429-439`: the selection
//! toolbar cannot ship inside `viewer.js`, which is a `<script src>` in
//! `viewer.html` and therefore only ever runs on the bundled template — which
//! is why quoting worked on markdown and did nothing on a website. It is a
//! `WKUserScript` injected into every page.
//!
//! `AddScriptToExecuteOnDocumentCreated` is the Windows equivalent, and the two
//! halves go in as a SINGLE source so their relative order is not a question a
//! future reader has to answer. Two rules ride along:
//!
//! - **Main frame only.** Mac's user script is `forMainFrameOnly: true`;
//!   WebView2 injects into every frame, so the blob's outermost guard is
//!   `window.top !== window`. The toolbar positions itself in viewport
//!   coordinates a subframe does not share, and a subframe is content we did
//!   not render — it does not get to post to native. The one exception is the
//!   link menu (T928), which rides a separate `subframe_js` blob and is the only
//!   message the pane accepts from a frame.
//! - **A missing bridge is not a missing toolbar.** If `chrome.webview` is not
//!   there, the shim skips its install and `selection.js` still runs: its own
//!   `post` already no-ops without a handler, so Copy keeps working and only
//!   Quote goes quiet.

// T385 — the drift detector for the handler SET, not just its name.
//
// The shim installs exactly one `window.webkit.messageHandlers.<name>`, and
// the test above proves that name is the one the shared JS looks up. What it
// cannot see is an ADDITION: if a Mac commit registers a second handler and
// the shared JS starts posting through it, Windows looks up a name the shim
// never installed, gets `undefined`, and `post()` returns quietly. No error on
// either side — the feature is simply absent here, and nothing says so.
//
// So the check reads BOTH ends of that drift. Mac's own source is checked in
// and therefore readable from this seat even though this lane never compiles
// Swift: every `userContentController.add(..., name:)` in the viewer's
// configuration must name the one handler the shim covers. And every
// `messageHandlers.<name>` in the shared scripts — the delivery vector, since
// they are embedded verbatim — must be that same name.

/// Swift source with `//` comments removed, so a doc comment naming a call or
/// a handler cannot be mistaken for one. String literals are preserved, since
/// the handler name lives in one.
