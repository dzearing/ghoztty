//! The screenshot region selector (T647): a full-desktop overlay showing a
//! dimmed photograph of the screen, out of which the user drags the rectangle
//! that becomes a feedback screenshot.
//!
//! This is D44's recommended answer built. The two Windows-native alternatives
//! — `ms-screenclip:` and `SnippingTool /clip` — both hand their result over
//! through the CLIPBOARD, and the whole point of a capture inside a feedback
//! composer is that it does not cost the user whatever they had copied. Mac's
//! `screencapture -i -o` is explicit about the same thing (`-o`, never `-c`),
//! so a Windows build that clobbered the clipboard would not be a translation
//! of the feature, it would be a different one.
//!
//! ## How it works, and why in that order
//!
//! 1. Photograph the whole virtual screen ONCE (`screen_capture.zig`), before
//!    this window exists. A second grab at the end would photograph this
//!    overlay instead of the desktop.
//! 2. Precompute a DIMMED copy of that photograph. Both are DIB sections, so
//!    every repaint is two `BitBlt`s — the dim everywhere, the original inside
//!    the selection — rather than a per-pixel pass at mouse-move rate.
//! 3. Show an opaque popup covering the virtual screen, take the drag, and on
//!    mouse-up crop the ORIGINAL photograph.
//!
//! Opaque rather than `WS_EX_LAYERED`: the window shows a picture of the
//! desktop, so there is nothing to be transparent to, and a layered
//! full-desktop window is the shape most likely to go wrong under an
//! aggressive foreground lock.
//!
//! ## Coordinates
//!
//! The window is placed AT the virtual screen's bounds, so its client
//! coordinates are the snapshot's own buffer coordinates and a message's
//! lparam needs no translation. Only the crop converts back to virtual-screen
//! coordinates, by adding the bounds origin. Rect math is in the pure
//! `region_select.zig`.
//!
//! ## Driving it without a mouse
//!
//! Every input this handles arrives as an ordinary window message read out of
//! `wparam`/`lparam` — nothing calls `GetCursorPos` or `GetKeyState`. That is
//! deliberate: the acceptance suite runs on a background desktop where
//! `SendInput` is dead (T233), so a drag has to be postable. `PostMessageW` of
//! `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` / `WM_MOUSEMOVE` / `WM_LBUTTONUP` (and `WM_KEYDOWN`
//! `VK_ESCAPE`) is a complete script for this window.
//!
//! ## The keyboard (T671)
//!
//! That property is also what makes a real keyboard path possible, so the
//! selector has one: arrows move a caret, Ctrl+arrow moves it 32 px at a time,
//! Enter pins the first corner and Enter again captures, Shift+arrow is the
//! shortcut that does both in one press, and Escape still cancels. The rules
//! are pure (`region_select.zig`: `moveCaret` / `dropAnchor`), so the keyboard
//! and the mouse drive the SAME `anchor`/`cursor` pair and can be interleaved.
//!
//! ## Picking a whole window (T670)
//!
//! Space toggles into WINDOW mode and back, which is the key and the gesture
//! Mac's `screencapture -i` uses. Aiming — with the pointer or with the arrows —
//! highlights the topmost window under the caret and a click (or Enter)
//! captures exactly it. Nothing about the paint path changes: window mode
//! answers `selection()` with the picked window's frame, so the bright rect,
//! the outline, the crop and the announced size all come out of the same
//! accessor a drag feeds.
//!
//! Two details are the whole accuracy of it. The frame is
//! `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS`, not `GetWindowRect`, because the latter
//! includes the invisible resize border and would give every capture a rim of
//! desktop. And the candidate walk is `EnumWindows` rather than
//! `WindowFromPoint`, because this overlay covers the entire virtual screen and
//! is therefore the window under the pointer everywhere — it has to be SKIPPED
//! by handle, and `WindowFromPoint` cannot be told to skip anything.
//!
//! Modifiers are tracked from the `WM_KEYDOWN`/`WM_KEYUP` of `VK_SHIFT` and
//! `VK_CONTROL` rather than read with `GetKeyState`, for the reason above: a
//! posted message carries no key state, so a `GetKeyState`-based Shift would be
//! unreachable from the harness and therefore untested. The one thing tracking
//! cannot see is a modifier that was ALREADY down when the overlay appeared —
//! Ctrl+Shift+S is exactly that — so `begin` seeds the pair once from the
//! creating thread's own queue state, and every release after that is an
//! ordinary `WM_KEYUP`.
//!
//! What the caret is doing is ANNOUNCED as well as drawn: the live position and
//! selection size go into the hint card AND into the window's text, which is
//! the name assistive tech reads (and, not by accident, the only oracle a
//! background-desktop script has for painted text).
