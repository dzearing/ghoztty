/// build with neither painter where the band stayed red. What actually made
/// T233's HOVER invisible to the capture is that the hover state does not
/// survive: a posted `WM_MOUSEMOVE` sets it and the OS posts `WM_MOUSELEAVE`
/// within a frame, because `TrackMouseEvent` watches a real cursor that is not
/// there (`split-divider.ps1`'s own header says so, and its hover oracle is the
