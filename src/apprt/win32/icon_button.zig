//! Pure geometry and state model for every icon button in the win32 chrome
//! (T204). No OS imports, so these unit tests run in every app-runtime lane
//! (the `split_geometry.zig` / `tab_strip_layout.zig` pattern).
//!
//! Why this module exists. The chrome grew four icon buttons over four
//! separate tasks, and each one open-coded its own treatment:
//!
//!   * "+"  (new tab)  — rounded hover fill, glyph drawn `DT_LEFT`
//!   * "≡"  (menu)     — rounded hover fill, glyph drawn `DT_CENTER`
//!   * "×"  (close)    — NO fill; hover only recolored the glyph red, `DT_LEFT`
//!   * chevron (banner collapse) — no hover, no hit state, no fill at all
//!
//! Four controls, four answers to the same question, so they could not agree
//! and did not. The user's report, 2026-07-30, naming all three symptoms:
//!
//! > "icon buttons should have a consistent design with consistent hover and
//! >  centered icons" ... "why doesn't the chevron in the banner have a
//! >  similar hover? why doesn't the x to close a tab have a similar hover?"
//!
//! And on the "+" specifically — its fill was a tab-height slab while the
//! glyph sat against the slab's left edge, so a hovered "+" read as a second
//! tab rather than a button.
//!
//! So the button model lives here, once: the shared square target, the
//! rounded fill inset inside it, the per-state shade, and the rule that the
//! glyph is centered on BOTH axes of that square. A site that wants an icon
//! button asks this module for its geometry; it does not get to invent one.
//! That is what makes the user's complaint un-reproducible by construction
//! rather than by three sites happening to agree.
//!
//! Measured target: `docs/design/win32-tab-strip.md`.
