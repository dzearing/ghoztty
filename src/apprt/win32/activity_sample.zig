//! Activity monitor sampling: the poll loop and the snapshot it produces.
//!
//! Split out of `ActivityMonitor.zig` (T299). One worker thread at a time
//! enumerates processes (locally, or over the connection for a remote card),
//! builds an arena-backed `Snapshot`, and parks it in `pending` for the GUI
//! thread to adopt on WM_APP_ACTIVITY_SAMPLE.
//!
//! Two rules make that safe and they both live here:
//!
//!   * **Generation.** Every sample carries the generation it was started
//!     under. A sample whose generation no longer matches is DROPPED and freed
//!     by the GUI thread — that is how a source switch, a resize, or a close
//!     cannot be overtaken by a sample the panel no longer wants.
//!   * **The gate.** `sample_gate` decides whether a hidden, minimized or
//!     occluded panel should keep polling at all. Suspending clears the trend
//!     ring, because a CPU% delta across a suspension is a lie.
//!
//! The commentary this file inherited from the panel's header:
//!
//! ## Threading
//! `proc.ProcSampler.sample` enumerates every process on the box and opens each
//! one — far too much to run on the GUI thread every 1.5 s, and Mac runs the
//! equivalent on a background queue (RemoteActivityMonitorView.swift:99-101). So
//! the timer kicks a worker thread that samples into an arena-backed `Snapshot`,
//! parks it under a mutex and posts `WM_APP_ACTIVITY_SAMPLE`; the GUI thread
//! adopts it. Exactly one sample is ever in flight (`sampling`), so the two
//! samplers are only ever touched by that worker, and `close` JOINS it before
//! freeing anything it could still be writing to.
