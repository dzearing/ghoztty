//! Pure geometry for the win32 tab strip (T202). No OS imports, so these unit
//! tests run in every app-runtime lane (the `split_geometry.zig` pattern).
//! The painting half is `paintTabBar` in Window.zig; the hit tests
//! (`handleTabBarClick`, `handleTabBarMouseMove`, `handleTabBarRightClick`)
//! consume the same rects, which is what keeps what you see and what you can
//! click from drifting apart.
//!
//! Target and measurements: `docs/design/win32-tab-strip.md`. The short
//! version, from reading pixels off a live Windows Terminal:
//!
//!   * A tab is NEVER handed the remainder of the strip. The old code gave
//!     the last tab `available - x`, so a single tab spanned the whole window;
//!     that one rule produced three of the four things the user called amateur
//!     (close button flung to the far edge, "+" jammed against the tab, and a
//!     full-width accent rule). That anti-stretch rule is permanent.
//!   * What a tab IS: its own content's width (title + padding), capped at
//!     **50% of the tab run** and floored at `min_tab_w`. Only when the
//!     preferred widths do not all fit does the strip fall back to the equal
//!     share T202 shipped, clamped to `[min_tab_w, cap]`, and only then does a
//!     title ellipsize. T202's fixed `max_tab_w = 200 DIP` is gone: it
//!     truncated titles with 1000px of empty strip beside them (T235, design
//!     system §6b). Measuring Windows Terminal's `TabWidthMode="Equal"` was
//!     right; concluding we had to copy its *algorithm* was too literal.
//!   * This module still measures no text. The caller measures the titles and
//!     passes preferred widths IN, which is what keeps the whole strip
//!     unit-testable with no window, no font and no DPI.
//!   * The "+" travels with the last tab (WinUI `AddTabButton`); the menu
//!     button is pinned right (WinUI `TabStripFooter`). Pinning both right
//!     made them read as one undifferentiated cluster.
//!   * Tabs can never be laid out under the button band. When they will not
//!     all fit at `min_tab_w`, the ones that do not fit get NO rect at all —
//!     invisible and unhittable — instead of being drawn off the end and
//!     painted over.

/// that once ran a long command would keep the whole strip squeezed for a

/// click targets. A *background* tab whose command starts widens that tab and
/// slides every tab right of it, so a click can still land on the wrong tab —
/// rarely, and only at the instant something starts, but structurally. The
/// caller passes `true` while the pointer is anywhere inside the strip, and the
/// ratchet then stops raising: widths cannot change under a pointer that is
/// pointing at them, which makes the wrong-tab hit impossible rather than
/// merely rare. The cost is that a tab needing more room stays ellipsized while
/// you hover it — a small, self-correcting, user-attributable state that ends
/// the moment the pointer leaves the strip and the caller repaints.
