//! Live per-session CPU for the machine chooser's session rows (T462) — the
//! win32 half of Mac's `SessionCPUProbe.swift`, fed by the agent's pushed
//! `session_cpu` stream.
//!
//! ## Pushed, not polled
//! The client asks for a cadence; the AGENT decides one. It floors the request,
//! stretches it when its own machine is loaded, and reports what it actually
//! used in every frame (`Server.throttledIntervalMs`). A fixed client-side poll
//! would hit a box hardest exactly when it is already struggling, and the
//! chooser has no way to know how loaded the far end is — only the agent does.
//! So the reported interval is READ, never assumed: that is what keeps a slow
//! stream distinguishable from a dead one.
//!
//! ## One subscription at a time
//! The chooser is transient master-detail UI, so this follows the SELECTED
//! machine and nothing else: moving the selection tears the old subscription
//! down before starting the new one, and closing the chooser guarantees no
//! stream — and no borrowed connection — outlives the dialog.
//!
//! ## Whose connection
//! Never its own. The LOCAL agent's is `LocalAgent`'s warm shared connection
//! (borrowed; a roster browse must never SPAWN an agent, so no warm connection
//! simply means no meter), and a remote machine's is the one warm connection
//! `MachineConnectionPool` holds for the chooser's lease (T461). Dialing a
//! second socket just to draw a meter is exactly what the pool exists to stop.
//!
//! ## A subscription can die without the connection saying so (T813)
//! Retargeting follows the SELECTION, and the selection is the only edge the
//! local agent has — there is no pool notification behind it. So a recovery
//! that replaces the shared connection while the chooser is open, an in-place
//! reconnect on the same `Connection` (new socket, no subscription on it), or
//! an agent that wedges with the link nominally up all end the stream with
//! nothing to observe: the last readings sit on screen forever, presented as
//! measurements. Two things answer that, and both are needed because each
//! misses what the other catches: the chooser re-checks the local agent's
//! connection every poll tick and retargets when the POINTER moved, and this
//! probe stops reporting `supported()` once the newest frame is older than the
//! agent's own cadence allows (`chooser_cpu.isStale`). The staleness rule is
//! stated on silence rather than on any particular cause, so it also covers the
//! causes nobody has thought of yet — and it un-stales itself the moment a
//! frame lands, so recovery needs no separate path.
//!
//! ## Degrading against an older agent
//! `Connection.subscribeSessionCpu` returns `error.Unsupported` when the peer
//! never advertised `capability.session_cpu` — an unknown opcode is a FATAL
//! framing error to an older agent, so the gate is what keeps a working
//! connection alive rather than politeness. Unsupported ⇒ `supported()` is
//! false ⇒ the roster reserves no column and draws no meter. Never a stale
//! number, never an invented one, and never a poll the agent did not agree to.
//!
//! `capability.cpu_units` needs no separate gate HERE: `session_cpu` was added
//! after the units fix and implies it (`protocol.zig`'s comment at
//! `capability.cpu_units`). The Activity Monitor's process table, whose
//! `cpu_pct` predates both, is what that capability exists for.
