//! The relay-account row of the win32 machine chooser (T141).
//!
//! Sign-in used to be a CLI verb on Windows (`+relay-login` / `+relay-logout`,
//! T21a). The Mac client never had those — it signs in from the machine
//! chooser's account header — and a one-platform CLI verb is exactly the
//! divergence the user ruled out, so the verbs were deleted and this is where
//! signing in lives now: the chooser's own affordance, mirroring
//! `MachineChooserView.accountRow` on the Mac.
//!
//! This module owns the ASYNC half — the part that must not run on the GUI
//! thread. `relay_signin.signIn` blocks for as long as the user takes to
//! complete a browser consent screen (minutes), and `signOut` does a network
//! revoke; either on the GUI thread would freeze every window. So both run on a
//! detached thread and post `WM_APP_RELAY_ACCOUNT` to the app's message-only
//! window (`AgentIntegration`'s pattern), which routes the outcome to whatever
//! chooser is open — or to nobody, if the user closed it while signing in. The
//! sign-in still took effect either way: the account store is the state, not
//! the dialog.
//!
//! `MachineChooser` owns the HWNDs and the redraw; everything here is either
//! pure (unit-tested label/status text) or off-thread.
