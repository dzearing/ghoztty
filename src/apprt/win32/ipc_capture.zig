//! The `capture-pane` IPC action (T275): write a PNG of a named terminal
//! pane's RENDERED content to a caller-supplied path.
//!
//! ## This is a test seam, not a product verb, and that is deliberate
//!
//! There is no `ghoztty +capture-pane` CLI command and there is not going to
//! be one. `src/cli/ghostty.zig`'s `Action` enum is shared by every apprt, so
//! a verb added there is a CROSS-PLATFORM CLI surface — the exact divergence
//! CLAUDE.md rules out and the reason `+relay-login` was removed in T141. What
//! this feature is FOR is an acceptance harness proving that the OpenGL glass
//! is showing what it should, off the background desktop where no composite
//! exists; the value of pixels to a user of an agent-driven terminal is far
//! below the value of `+read`'s text, and a screenshot verb shipped for the
//! suite's convenience is a surface we would then have to keep forever on both
//! platforms.
//!
//! So the action is reachable only over the IPC endpoint, only from a build
//! where `build_config.is_debug` holds (Debug/ReleaseSafe), and the harness
//! frames the request itself (`test/win32/lib/PaneCapture.ps1`). A shipped
//! ReleaseFast build answers `unknown action: capture-pane`, exactly as it does
//! for a verb it has never heard of. That gate costs the suite nothing: T350
//! already requires every acceptance script to run against a Debug build,
//! because the IPC endpoint, the agent pipe and the state directory are all
//! derived from the build mode.
//!
//! ## The wire shape
//!
//! ```
//! {"action":"capture-pane","arguments":[
//!    "--target=<pane|window|pane-id>","--path=<file.png>",
//!    "--width=<px>","--height=<px>"]}
//! ```
//!
//! → `{"success":true,"data":{"path":…,"width":N,"height":N,"bytes":N,
//!     "x":N,"y":N,"client_width":N,"client_height":N}}`
//!
//! `x`/`y` are the captured content area's top-left in SCREEN pixels and
//! `client_width`/`client_height` its unscaled size (T778). One capture does
//! not need them; a harness composing a WINDOW out of several does, because
//! that is the one thing route 0 cannot answer on its own — where this glass
//! sits relative to the parent chrome and the other panes.
//!
//! `--target` goes through the same resolver every other verb uses, so a
//! registered pane name, a window name (its focused pane), or a `$GHOZTTY_PANE_ID`
//! all work. Sizes default to the pane's own client size.
