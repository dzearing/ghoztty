//! The win32 Activity Monitor panel (T285) — the port of Mac's
//! `RemoteActivityMonitor.swift` + `RemoteActivityMonitorView.swift`. Windows had
//! ZERO of this surface before T226 split into T284..T287.
//!
//! ## The split
//! All arithmetic lives in pure modules that run in every test lane:
//! `activity_layout.zig` (regions + column widths, T284), `trend_gauge.zig`
//! (chart geometry, T284), `activity_rows.zig` (filter / sort / cell text,
//! T285), `activity_actions.zig` (kill/spawn wording and pruning, T286),
//! `activity_cards.zig` (carousel ordering, T296), `activity_borrow.zig`
//! (which window's connection to reuse, T295) and `activity_probe.zig` (probe
//! policy, T298) — the same division that keeps `chooser_layout.zig` testable
//! while `MachineChooser.zig` keeps the win32 surface.
//!
//! The win32 surface was itself one 4,900-line file until T299 split it along
//! the seams that were already section banners inside it. Each plane below owns
//! its own rules AND the commentary that explains them, so a rule is read where
//! it is enforced:
//!
//! | File | Owns |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ActivityMonitor.zig` (this file) | the window: state, open/close, the registry, the wndProc |
//! | `activity_dial.zig` | the connection plane — dialing, borrowing, teardown (T295) |
//! | `activity_machines.zig` | the machine list and the carousel (T296) |
//! | `activity_probe_conn.zig` | the per-card metrics probes' connections (T298) |
//! | `activity_sample.zig` | the poll loop, the gate, and the snapshot |
//! | `activity_view.zig` | filter / selection / scroll, layout and chrome |
//! | `activity_paint.zig` | every pixel |
//! | `activity_input.zig` | mouse, and the keyboard focus ring (T289) |
//! | `activity_procs.zig` | Kill and New Process (T286) |
//!
//! Those files call back into the panel by METHOD, so the aliases under
//! "Split modules" below are the panel's namespace: a function the window
//! calls is a function a plane promised, and the list is where those promises
//! are readable in one place.
//!
//! ## Registry
//! One panel per SOURCE. A second open focuses the existing panel instead of
//! duplicating it, mirroring `RemoteActivityMonitor.focusExisting`
//! (RemoteActivityMonitor.swift:146-150). The slot arithmetic is pure and
//! unit-tested at the bottom of this file.
//!
//! Two of its pieces are load-bearing far from here, so they are worth naming
//! up front. A slot can be REUSED by a different panel between the moment a
//! worker starts and the moment its result lands, which is what `serial` and
//! `panelMatches` exist to catch. And every result that carries a live
//! connection — a dial, a probe dial, a machine list — is posted to the APP's
//! message-only window rather than to the panel's: `DestroyWindow` drops a
//! window's queued messages, so a result posted to a panel that closes first
//! would be discarded with an open connection inside it.
