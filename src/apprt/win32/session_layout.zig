//! Viewer-side session-layout manifest — the win32 port of the macOS
//! `SessionLayoutManifest` (`macos/Sources/Features/Remote/
//! SessionLayoutManifest.swift`). This is the LOCAL, same-host restore file
//! the GUI writes so that after a quit / logoff / reboot the next launch can
//! rebuild its windows/tabs/splits and re-ATTACH each pane to the session the
//! local `ghoztty-agent` kept alive (T89d/T89e). It is the app's OWN copy;
//! the agent's crash-durable `layout_meta.zig` blob store is the separate
//! cross-machine path (§5.4/T18) and is not involved here.
//!
//! Layering: like `layout_meta.zig`/`session_meta.zig`/`tab_color.zig`, this
//! module depends on nothing but `std` (+ `builtin` for the debug-file split),
//! so it compiles and unit-tests in every app-runtime lane. The topology WALK
//! that reads live `Window`/`Surface` state lives in `App.zig`
//! (`syncSessionLayout`); this module owns the schema and the bytes on disk.
//! The RESTORE reader (probe → rebuild → ATTACH) is T89f2.
//!
//! ## On-disk shape
//!
//!   {"version":1,"windows":[
//!     {"id":"win-0","uuid":"<uuid>","frame":{"x":..,"y":..,"w":..,"h":..},
//!      "maximized":false,
//!      "title_override":..?,"ipc_name":..?,"active_tab":0,
//!      "tabs":[{"nodes":[{"split":{"layout":"horizontal","ratio":0.5,
//!                                  "left":1,"right":2}},
//!                        {"leaf":{"session_id":"<32hex>","pane_id":"<uuid>",
//!                                 "title":..?,"banner":..?}},
//!                        {"leaf":{"session_id":"<32hex>"}}],
//!               "color":"blue"?,"hero_ratio":..?,"title":..?,"active":true}]}]}
//!
//! Keys are the Zig field names verbatim (snake_case). This file is the win32
//! app's private local-restore state and is never decoded by the macOS app
//! (which keeps its own Application Support manifest), so there is no
//! cross-lineage key-compatibility constraint — only the additive within-win32
//! one below.
//!
//! The split tree is stored FLAT (a `nodes` array, index 0 = root) with child
//! `left`/`right` as indices into that same array — this mirrors the internal
//! `SplitTree(V).nodes` representation exactly, so capture is a 1:1 index copy
//! and restore a 1:1 rebuild, and it sidesteps recursive-pointer JSON. A `Node`
//! is a plain object with two mutually-exclusive optional members (`leaf` /
//! `split`) rather than a tagged union, so the JSON needs no union-tag handling.
//!
//! ## Crash safety
//!
//! `writeAtomic` delegates to `atomic_write.writeChunks`, like
//! `layout_meta.writeAtomic` — safe under concurrent writers to the same path
//! (T183). Every field an older/newer build doesn't know is ignored on read
//! (`ignore_unknown_fields`), and absent optionals fall back — the
//! additive-evolution contract the whole app↔agent boundary follows.
