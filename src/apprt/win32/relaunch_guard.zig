//! A supervisor for the one window of time in which the app is allowed to
//! disappear: the destructive agent refresh (T421, after T229).
//!
//! The mandatory confirmation promises the panes come back. Twice now — T229's
//! two occurrences and again on 2026-08-03 — the user consented and the app
//! simply ended: no crash record, no further log line, no windows, and nothing
//! that would ever bring it back. The user relaunched Ghoztty by hand fourteen
//! minutes later.
//!
//! T229 attacked the cause and could not reproduce it in four shapes. This
//! module attacks the OUTCOME instead, which is the half the user actually
//! feels: whatever kills the app between "I confirmed" and "my panes are back",
//! something outside that process must notice and start it again.
//!
//! Shape: before the destructive step the app ARMS the guard —
//!
//!  1. writes a marker file (its own pid + the exe to relaunch), then
//!  2. spawns a detached copy of `ghoztty.exe` carrying
//!     `GHOZTTY_RELAUNCH_GUARD=<pid>|<marker>|<exe>` in its environment.
//!
//! That copy is not a terminal: `runFromEnv` sees the variable before any app
//! state exists, waits on the armed pid, and exits. If the app clears the marker
//! (a refresh that finished, however it finished) the guard exits quietly. If
//! the app's process ENDS while the marker is still there, the guard relaunches
//! it and then removes the marker.
//!
//! Deliberate properties:
//!
//! - **The window is seconds wide.** The marker exists only across
//!   `restartForUpgrade` + the in-place rebuild, so a user who quits Ghoztty
//!   deliberately is not fighting a relaunch — they would have to quit inside
//!   that window.
//! - **It relaunches at most once.** The guard exits after spawning, and the
//!   relaunched app does not inherit the variable, so a crash loop cannot be
//!   manufactured out of this.
//! - **It cannot outlive its purpose.** `max_wait_ms` caps the whole watch.
//! - **No `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`.** That flag is inherited by every
//!   descendant and disables Ctrl-C for all of them (T84) — a relaunched app
//!   whose panes ignore ^C would be a worse bug than the one being fixed.
//! - **It breaks out of the app's job object** (T524). A child joins its
//!   parent's job by default, and a job teardown kills every member at once —
//!   which is how four production guards died WITH the app they were
//!   watching, before executing one instruction. A supervisor that shares its
//!   subject's fate supervises nothing. `job_spawn.spawnEscapingJob` escapes
//!   in tiers: `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`, then a shell-parent hop for the
//!   job chains that refuse breakaway (this box's do), then a jobless donor
//!   found by enumeration where there is no shell window to ask (T674), then
//!   in-job as a loud last resort. It lives in its own module because the local agent needs
//!   the identical escape for the identical reason (T426).
//! - **No new CLI surface.** It is an environment variable, not a `+verb`:
//!   `ghoztty`'s command set stays identical on both platforms (CLAUDE.md's
//!   standing rule), and the same variable is available to the Mac seat when it
//!   wires the equivalent (T427).
