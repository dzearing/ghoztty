//! Dark-mode replacement for the light `MessageBoxW` prompts (T80).
//!
//! A small owner-centered dialog in the T50 RenameDialog pattern — dark
//! caption, dark client, system icon, message text, OK/Cancel — but with a
//! *synchronous* API: `show` disables the owner, runs its own nested
//! message loop (exactly what MessageBoxW does internally, which the T48
//! analysis established is WndProc-safe: the thread keeps pumping, so the
//! IME/CTF cascade and the IPC message-only window stay live), and returns
//! the user's choice. That keeps every caller's control flow identical to
//! the MessageBoxW it replaces.
//!
//! Semantics preserved from the MessageBoxW sites:
//!   - `default_cancel` mirrors MB_DEFBUTTON2: initial focus and the Enter
//!     default land on Cancel so an accidental Enter never approves a
//!     destructive action.
//!   - Escape cancels (for `ok_only` it simply dismisses).
//!   - The ✕ close box cancels.
