//! The region selector's rect math (T647), the pure half of the feedback
//! composer's screenshot capture.
//!
//! A drag has two corners and no order: the user may pull the rectangle out of
//! any of its four corners, and the one they started from is whichever they
//! pressed on. Everything downstream — the crop out of the screen snapshot, the
//! bright window painted over the dim, the PNG's width and height — wants a
//! NORMALIZED rect instead: a top-left origin and a non-negative size. Getting
//! that wrong is invisible in a right-and-down drag, which is the one a
//! developer tries first, and produces an empty or inverted crop in the other
//! three.
//!
//! It is also where "a click is not a screenshot" lives. A zero-area drag —
//! press and release without moving, or a drag along a single row or column —
//! is a CANCEL, not an empty image: a 0x0 PNG is not something anybody asked
//! for, and a 200x0 one is worse because it looks like it worked.
//!
//! No OS imports, so this asserts in every app-runtime lane.
