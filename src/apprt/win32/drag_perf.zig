//! T1343: what one splitter-drag motion tick COSTS, and whether the drag the
//! user is watching is smooth or steppy.
//!
//! A divider drag is one `WM_MOUSEMOVE` → `updateDividerDrag` →
//! `layoutSplitsLive` per motion tick, and the whole chain runs on the UI
//! thread, so the tick's wall clock IS the drag's frame time: a tick that
//! costs 60 ms is a drag that moves four times a second no matter how fast the
//! mouse is reporting. The user's 2026-09-04 report ("resizing panes is janky
//! and slow ... it feels so unpolished") was about exactly that number, and
//! nothing had ever measured it.
//!
//! The cost that dominates it is a WAIT, not work: each resized pane blocks
//! the UI thread on its renderer presenting a frame at the new size, so the
//! anti-flicker guarantee is bought once per pane. `serialWaitCeilingUs` and
//! `batchedWaitCeilingUs` below are the two shapes of that bill — the first is
//! what the code did until T1343, the second is what it does now — and the
//! whole point of the fix is that only one of them grows with the pane count.
//!
//! Same split as `layout_cost.zig` beside it: pure arithmetic here, the
//! Windows-facing half (the clock, the event handles, the log line) in
//! `Window.zig`.
