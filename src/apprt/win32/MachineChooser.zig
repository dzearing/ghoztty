//! Modal "New Remote Window" machine chooser for the win32 apprt (T22c).
//!
//! The GUI counterpart to `ghoztty +new-remote-window`: ctrl+shift+n opens
//! this picker (also reachable via the "New Remote Window" command-palette
//! entry), which lists the signed-in account's enrolled relay devices and,
//! on selection, dials that machine and opens a window on it — the same relay
//! dial + `createWindow` the `+new-remote-window` IPC verb performs (routed
//! through the shared `App.openRelayWindow`, so there is ONE relay-open path).
//!
//! Modeled on `RenameDialog.zig` (the T50 pattern-setter): a real owner-
//! centered modal popup (caption, dark chrome, native controls) whose owner
//! window is disabled while it is open, with the app message loop still
//! running so the renderer thread and the IPC server stay live. Enter/Escape/
//! Tab/Up/Down never reach the native controls — the main message loop routes
//! them here via `handleKey` (see `App.machineChooserOwning`), exactly like
//! the rename dialog.
//!
//! Shape (T175): a master-detail chooser, ported from Mac's 840x540
//! `MachineChooserView` — account row across the top, a fixed-width machine
//! column on a faint wash at the left, a detail pane at the right carrying the
//! selected machine's identity and its primary action, and a footer holding
//! Cancel alone. The geometry is pure and lives in `chooser_layout.zig`; the
//! wash, the rules and the detail header are painted in `WM_PAINT` rather than
//! built from STATICs, so they can use the same GDI glyph routine the list rows
//! do.
//!
//! Data (rewritten by T711): the dialog NEVER waits on the network to open.
//! It seeds instantly from `machine_cache` — the last device list this account
//! saw, with every seeded row drawn as "checking" because a remembered dot
//! would be a lie — and a `DirectoryProbe` fetch runs on a detached thread,
//! landing back here as `onDevices`. While the chooser is open that same fetch
//! re-runs every `chooser_refresh.poll_ms`, so renames, removals and machines
//! coming online appear under the user's eyes instead of on the next open; a
//! transient failure keeps the list that is already true and stays quiet until
//! it has missed three ticks in a row. No credential, or a fetch error,
//! degrades to a "Local"-only list plus a footer hint — never a crash
//! (T22a decision 1).
//!
//! Account (T141): the dialog's top row is the signed-in Google account —
//! email plus a Sign In / Sign Out button — mirroring the Mac chooser's
//! `accountRow`. This is the ONLY place a relay sign-in is initiated; the
//! `+relay-login` / `+relay-logout` CLI verbs that used to do it were deleted
//! because the Mac client never had them. The async half lives in
//! `RelayAccountRow.zig`; signing in re-fetches the device list in place.
