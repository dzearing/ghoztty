//! Activity monitor machine list and carousel (T296).
//!
//! Split out of `ActivityMonitor.zig` (T299). This is where the panel learns
//! which machines exist and turns them into the strip of cards along the top:
//! the relay directory fetch and its worker, the card rebuild that merges
//! directory entries with live windows and probe results, and `switchToCard`,
//! which is the one click that moves the whole panel to another machine.
//!
//! `activity_cards.zig` is the pure half — how many cards fit, which one is
//! centred, what a summary line says. This file is the stateful half, and the
//! rule that matters here is that the card list is REBUILT rather than
//! patched: a machine that went away, a window that connected, a probe that
//! answered all land in the same place, so there is one code path deciding
//! what a card says instead of four.
//!
//! `switchToCard` hands off to the connection plane (`activity_dial.zig`) for
//! everything with a lifetime in it — tearing the old source down, borrowing a
//! window's connection, or dialing a new one.
//!
//! The commentary this file inherited from the panel's header:
//!
//! ## The machine carousel (T296)
//! Once open, the panel moves to any other source in ONE click, without opening
//! a second window (Mac's `RemoteActivityMonitorModel.switchTo`,
//! RemoteActivityMonitorView.swift:307). Three parts:
//!
//! - **The list.** Mac reads a local `MachineRegistry`; Windows' machine list is
//!   the relay directory, and `relay_directory.listDevices` is a synchronous
//!   authenticated HTTPS GET. The chooser can afford that on the GUI thread
//!   because it is a modal dialog with a spinner; a non-modal panel cannot, so
//!   the fetch runs on a detached thread and lands as
//!   `WM_APP_ACTIVITY_MACHINES` on the APP's message-only window — the same
//!   outlives-the-panel reasoning as the dial.
//! - **The cards.** `activity_cards.zig` owns the ordering (Local first), the
//!   three lines of text, the status dot and the focus arithmetic. The ACTIVE
//!   source always gets a card even when the directory does not list it (a
//!   borrowed connection, a signed-out account, a machine deleted while the
//!   panel is open) — a carousel that cannot show you where you are is lying.
//! - **The switch.** `switchTo` tears the current source down, resets every
//!   view field so one machine's trend history can never bleed into another's,
//!   and starts the new one. It BUMPS `serial`, which is what makes an
//!   in-flight dial for the abandoned source land on `onDialed`'s
//!   panel-is-gone path and free itself instead of being adopted under the new
//!   machine's name.
//!
//! A sample worker started for the previous source is dropped by GENERATION
//! (`source_gen`), not by joining: joining a worker parked on a BORROWED
//! connection would freeze the GUI for up to `rpc_timeout_ns`, and a borrowed
//! connection cannot be `shutdown` to cut it short — it is a live window's
//! shell.
