//! Sticky pane-banner overlay (T35/T91). Windows analog of the Mac
//! `SurfacePaneBanner`: a card rendered above the terminal content of a
//! pane that persists (survives scrolling, screen clears, content updates)
//! until changed or cleared.
//!
//! Like DimOverlay/Scrollbar, the banner is a WS_EX_LAYERED popup owned by
//! its surface HWND — DWM composites it above the surface's OpenGL
//! content, which a plain child window cannot reliably do. Unlike the dim
//! overlay it is NOT click-through: `[text](url)` links are clickable
//! (hand cursor + ShellExecuteW), a multi-line banner collapses/expands on
//! click, and a click on a single-line banner focuses the pane underneath.
//!
//! The window covers the band the layout reserves above the terminal
//! (T101) and is fully OPAQUE (T131): it paints the pane background, then
//! the floating glass card inside it (`banner_card.zig`, the port of Mac's
//! `GlassCardBackground`). It used to be a translucent full-width strip,
//! which let the stale terminal pixels behind the band show through — that
//! see-through is what read as "text scrolling behind the banner".
//!
//! Content comes from the pure banner_markdown block parser (unit tested
//! in every lane): text lines, headings, thematic-break rules, lists with
//! a shared marker gutter (bullets / ordered numbers / native checkbox
//! boxes), and pipe tables with bold-measured column widths, `:` alignment
//! and long-cell word wrap. This file owns only the windowing, GDI
//! measurement, and painting.

//
// It was written because the acceptance script could not reach the hovered
// frame — on the background test desktop there is no real pointer, so Windows
// delivers WM_MOUSELEAVE a frame after every posted WM_MOUSEMOVE and the
// hovered paint never happened. T282 removed that limit (`capture-hover` holds
// the probe on one GUI-thread stack) and `pane-banner.ps1` now asserts the
// solid rule on the real composited overlay. This test stays: it is the
// cheapest form of the claim, it runs in the win32 unit lane with no GUI to
// launch, and a DIB comparison isolates the underline from everything else
// that could make a capture differ.
// T835: the overlay draws its card into a DC handed to it by WM_PRINTCLIENT,
// and draws the SAME card it would paint itself.
//
// This is the shipped half of the fix for a flake that cost a P0 investigation
// aimed at the wrong code. `Get-TestWindowPixels -Sync` — the capture every
// pixel assertion in pane-banner.ps1 now uses — is `PrintWindow` with no flags,
// which is this message and nothing else. The alternative it replaces asks DWM
// for an asynchronous copy of the layered window's composited surface, and that
// copy tears: three back-to-back captures of one unchanged overlay put the end
// of the same table row at 1062, 1283 and 1179 px while the app's own paint was
// identical every time. So a handler going missing here does not fail loudly in
// the app — it quietly makes a whole acceptance script measure noise again.
//
// Asserted against `paint` itself rather than against any particular pixel: the
// claim is "the message routes to the real paint", which is exactly what a
// byte-for-byte match with a direct paint into the same DIB proves.
