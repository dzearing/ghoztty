//! Should a terminal surface's `WM_ERASEBKGND` paint the flat background, or
//! leave the pixels where they are for the GL frame that is already coming?
//!
//! T1031. The old answer was "always", with the comment that "the OpenGL
//! renderer will overwrite the entire client area on the next frame". The
//! *next* frame is the whole problem: the erase is synchronous and the GL
//! frame is not, so every erase puts one displayed frame of flat background
//! on screen before the content comes back. During a divider drag that is one
//! flash per motion tick, which is the strobing the user reported.
//!
//! The fill is not useless, though, and deleting it outright would trade a
//! flash for garbage:
//!
//!   * The search bar and the command palette are POPUPS registered under the
//!     same window class as the terminal surface, so they arrive at the same
//!     handler. They have no GL renderer behind them and paint their chrome in
//!     `WM_PAINT`; without the fill their background is whatever the desktop
//!     left there.
//!   * A surface that has never presented a frame has nothing behind it
//!     either. That is window creation, a restored session before its first
//!     draw, and a pane whose renderer has not started. Flat background is the
//!     right answer there — it is what the window is *about* to look like.
//!
//! So the rule is narrow: skip the fill only for the terminal surface window
//! itself, and only once the renderer has actually put a frame in it. Pure so
//! the rule is unit-testable in the `none` lane rather than only observable by
//! looking at a window.
