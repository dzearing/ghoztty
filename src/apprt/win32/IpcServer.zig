//! IPC server for the win32 apprt: a named-pipe listener owned by the App
//! (docs/design/windows-parity-spec.md, "Architecture decisions"). The pipe
//! is created with an owner-only DACL and FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE, so
//! binding doubles as the single-instance lock: a second GUI launch fails to
//! bind, forwards a `new-window` request as a client, and exits.
//!
//! Connections are short-lived request/response (4-byte BE length + JSON,
//! both directions — the exact Mac wire protocol). Each request is marshaled
//! to the GUI thread via the App's message-only window (WM_APP_IPC +
//! ResetEvent), because all registry/window operations must run on the GUI
//! thread — so verbs still EXECUTE serially no matter how many arrive.
//!
//! ACCEPTING, however, is pooled across `instance_count` pipe instances, one
//! listener thread each (T111b). With a single instance the listener could
//! only accept while no request was outstanding, so ANY slow handler stopped
//! the server from accepting at all — and a client that cannot connect does
//! not report "busy", it exhausts its PIPE_BUSY retries and prints "No
//! running Ghoztty instance found." Measured: with the one instance occupied,
//! every other `+list` failed with that string after ~9.2 s, which is the
//! whole of T111's "the GUI-thread pipe listener has stopped ACCEPTING" and
//! the 9227 ms `+read` that looked like a read-latency regression but never
//! reached the handler at all. Pooling degrades a slow handler to SLOW
//! instead of ABSENT.
