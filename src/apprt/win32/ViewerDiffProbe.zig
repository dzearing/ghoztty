//! Off-UI-thread git for one diff viewer pane (T463; Mac's `ViewerDiffLoader`,
//! which does the same job on a `DispatchQueue`).
//!
//! The spec, the argv shaping and the output parsing are `viewer_diff.zig`,
//! which is pure and asserts in the none lane. What lives here is the part that
//! has to touch the OS: spawning `git`, reading untracked files off disk,
//! keeping both OFF the message loop, and posting a completion back to the
//! pane's host window.
//!
//! **Nothing here may run on the UI thread.** A listing is three to six process
//! spawns and a patch is one more, and the win32 viewer's message loop is the
//! same one the terminal next door draws on — a `git diff` on it is a visible
//! stall in a pane that has nothing to do with the viewer.
//!
//! ## Two requests, one worker
//!
//! A pane asks for two different things — the FILE LIST (eager, cheap even on a
//! thousand-file range) and ONE FILE'S PATCH (only when that file is opened) —
//! and they must not race each other into git. So there is exactly one worker
//! slot: a request arriving while one is out is remembered and re-issued from
//! the completion, which is also what keeps a live-refreshing status pane from
//! stacking spawns behind a slow repository.
//!
//! The same rule is what makes a stale answer harmless: only the newest request
//! of each kind survives, so a fast click-through of a file list never renders a
//! file the reader has already moved past.
