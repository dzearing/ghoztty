//! Finds or spawns the local `ghoztty-agent` and hands back a dialed
//! connection to it — the Windows local end of session persistence (T89d,
//! design §T89a decision 3). Panes backed by this agent survive the app
//! process (quit, crash, upgrade) and can be re-attached (T89f).
//!
//! The Windows local transport is a byte-mode named pipe
//! (`\\.\pipe\ghoztty-agent[-debug]-<user>`) with an owner-only DACL (T89c):
//! the DACL stands in for the Mac's 0600 AF_UNIX + SO_PEERCRED same-uid gate —
//! only this user can reach the shell (unlike a 127.0.0.1 TCP port).
//!
//! Discovery order, mirroring `LocalAgentManager` on the Mac:
//!
//!  1. **Find**: read the agent's info file (`port.json`, written after its
//!     pipe binds), dial the recorded `pipe`. The dial BLOCKS through the
//!     HELLO handshake, so a non-null handle IS the health check.
//!  2. **Spawn**: launch `ghoztty-agent.exe` (a sibling of `ghoztty.exe`,
//!     override via `GHOSTTY_LOCAL_AGENT_BIN`) DETACHED so it outlives the
//!     app, with `--listen-pipe`/`--port-file`/`--sessions-file`, then poll
//!     the info file until a dial succeeds (bounded).
//!
//! All state lives in a per-lineage dir keyed by the debug/release build
//! (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\local-agent[-debug]\`) so the debug app never
//! shares an agent — or its sessions — with the release app (design §T89a
//! decision 2). The agent's single-instance guard uses a distinct `local`
//! key (T89d1), so a concurrent double-spawn (or a coexisting relay agent) is
//! safe: the loser exits cleanly.
//!
//! Default-on (`session-persistence`, T19 / config): the resolve is BOUNDED
//! and non-fatal — a broken or unspawnable agent yields null within
//! `spawn_deadline_ms`, and the caller opens a plain exec surface for that
//! window instead of hanging. After a failure, new surfaces fall back to exec
//! for `failure_cooldown_ms` so an unspawnable agent never re-beachballs every
//! window.
