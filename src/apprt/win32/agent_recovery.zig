//! In-place local-agent crash recovery policy (T145) — the win32 port of the
//! Mac `LocalAgentManager.SharedLinkDropVerdict` / `SessionCloseIntentPolicy`
//! pair (`03f0f1f30` + `e65cfa4d5`).
//!
//! When the local `ghoztty-agent` dies while the GUI stays up, every persistent
//! pane is frozen: its PTY went with the agent and the app's shared connection
//! is a dead pointer. Recovery re-dials (spawning a fresh agent if needed) and
//! rebuilds each local-agent window's split topology in place — no app relaunch.
//! The mechanism lives in `App.zig`; the DECISIONS live here, pure, so they are
//! unit-testable in both app-runtime lanes without a live agent.
//!
//! Two decisions, and both exist because getting them wrong is destructive:
//!
//!  1. **When is a dropped link real?** Recovery replaces every local window's
//!     surface tree, so it must never run on a blip. The Mac shipped this
//!     without a settle window and the 2026-07-21 incident (`e65cfa4d5`) had
//!     in-place recovery destroying the sessions it had just re-attached, fired
//!     by a link that healed 27ms later. The transport FSM
//!     (`remote/connection.zig` §5.1) enters `reconnecting` after three missed
//!     heartbeats and returns to `connected` on the very next authentic packet,
//!     so a down edge is NOT proof of death — only a link that STAYS down
//!     through `settle_ms` is.
//!  2. **Whose session may be ended?** The swap replaces live surfaces with
//!     fresh ones that re-ATTACH the SAME agent sessions. A departing leaf is
//!     therefore not a user close, and marking it close-intent would terminate
//!     the child of a session an on-screen pane is using. The invariant is
//!     stated in terms of session ids (`sessionSpared`), not in terms of "is
//!     this a swap?", so it holds for any future tree-replacing caller.
//!  3. **Which LEAVES does recovery touch at all?** Only the ones that rode the
//!     dropped connection (`rebuildsLeaf`), and only while the live tree still
//!     matches what was captured from it (`shapesCorrespond`).
