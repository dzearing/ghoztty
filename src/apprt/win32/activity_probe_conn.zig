//! Activity monitor per-card metrics probes: the connections (T298).
//!
//! Split out of `ActivityMonitor.zig` (T299). `activity_probe.zig` is the pure
//! half — which machines to probe, when to retry one that refused, when a
//! probe that stopped answering stops being believed. This file is the other
//! half: the dials, the metrics subscriptions, and the rules that keep them
//! from outliving the panel.
//!
//! Every rule here is an OWNERSHIP rule, and getting one wrong leaks a
//! connection or frees a live window's shell:
//!
//!   * **Unsubscribe before join, join before free.** `stopProbe` drops the
//!     metrics link first, then waits for the dial thread, and only then frees
//!     the connection — in that order, always.
//!   * **A dial that lands late frees itself.** Each probe carries a serial;
//!     `onProbeDialed` checks the panel is still in the slot it started in and
//!     still on the same serial, and closes what it was handed if not.
//!   * **A borrowed connection is never freed here.** A probe that adopted a
//!     window's live connection releases the borrow instead — the window owns
//!     it.
//!
//! `deferProbe` exists because a probe cannot be freed from inside its own
//! metrics callback: the callback runs on the connection's reader thread, and
//! joining that thread from itself deadlocks.
//!
//! The commentary this file inherited from the panel's header:
//!
//! ## Per-card metrics probes (T298)
//! Every card carries a live readout, not just the active one — Mac's
//! `MachineMetricsProbe` (MachineMetricsProbe.swift:72-134). An INACTIVE remote
//! card is fed by a PROBE: its own dialed connection plus a metrics
//! subscription, one per machine, held while the panel is observable. The
//! Local card, when it is not the source, is fed by a plain local sampler (no
//! connection needed — the box is right here).
//!
//! Four rules make that a budget rather than a leak, and `activity_probe.zig`
//! owns every one of them as pure policy:
//!
//! - **A probe owns its connection.** Never the panel's, never a window's.
//!   Since T1632 the metrics stream multiplexes, so sharing would no longer
//!   clobber anyone; owning it is what Mac does and keeps teardown uniform.
//! - **The active source is not probed.** Its card is the panel's own live
//!   connection; a probe would be a second link to the machine you are looking
//!   at. Mac excludes it the same way.
//! - **A refused dial backs off** (30 s doubling to a 5 min ceiling) instead of
//!   retrying in a loop, and a probe that stops pushing is RETIRED after five
//!   missed intervals rather than left painting its last reading forever.
//! - **A suspended panel probes nothing.** T290 stood the enumeration down when
//!   nobody can see the panel; N held-open connections are the same waste, so
//!   they go with it and are re-dialed on resume.
//!
//! Card summaries still fall back to the relay directory's `online` flag when
//! no probe has reached a machine, which is all any inactive card ever had
//! before this — a state we do not have is a state we do not paint.

// Per-card metrics probes (T298)
//
// Mac's `MachineMetricsProbe` dials every registered machine and holds a
// metrics subscription on each for the panel's whole life, which is what puts a
// live `up 3d 4h` / `CPU 12% · Mem 40%` on the cards the panel is NOT showing.
// This is the same thing with Windows' transports.
//
// One rule keeps the whole design honest: **a probe OWNS the connection it
// uses.** It never rides a window's connection, and never the panel's own.
// That used to be forced — `Connection` had exactly ONE metrics handler slot,
// so a second subscriber clobbered the first. T1632 made the stream a
// fan-out, so it is now a choice: dialing our own is what Mac does, and it
// makes teardown one uniform sequence per probe: unsubscribe (no further
// callback can fire into `p`), then free.
//
// The active source is deliberately not probed: its card is fed by the panel's
// own live connection, so a probe would be a second connection to the machine
// you are already looking at.
