//! What a notification-area callback message MEANS (T448) — the decode half
//! of the balloon-click path, kept free of app state so it can be asserted
//! without a window, an HWND or a running shell. The plumbing (showing the
//! balloon, focusing the surface, opening the release page) lives in
//! `App.zig`; nothing here touches one.
//!
//! **The registration is the load-bearing part.** The shell only sends the
//! `NIN_*` balloon notifications — including `NIN_BALLOONUSERCLICK`, the one
//! that makes clicking a notification jump to the pane that raised it — to an
//! icon that has asked for Windows 2000-or-later behavior. Registering an
//! icon with `NIM_ADD` alone leaves it on the shell's default pre-5.0
//! ("Windows 95") behavior, where a balloon click produces nothing and every
//! handler below is dead code. MSDN is unambiguous about the cure and its
//! cadence: *"NIM_SETVERSION must be called every time a notification area
//! icon is added (NIM_ADD) … The version setting is not persisted once a user
//! logs off."* That call was missing until T448, which is why the click-to-
//! focus code shipped, read correctly, and had never once run.
//!
//! **Version 3, not 4.** `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4` turns the same `NIN_*`
//! messages on but REPACKS the callback: `wparam` becomes the cursor anchor
//! and `lparam` becomes `(event, uID)`. Version 3 enables the notifications
//! while keeping the `wparam = uID` / `lparam = event` packing that
//! `classify` below decodes, and it fits the Windows 2000-sized
//! `NOTIFYICONDATAW` our binding deliberately stops short of (no `guidItem`,
//! no `hBalloonIcon`). We want the messages, not the repacking.
