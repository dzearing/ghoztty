//! The viewer pane's feedback composer (T634, the win32 half of Mac's
//! `ViewerFeedbackBar`): an owner-painted native child window that slides in
//! below the nav bar and above the page, carrying a pill that grows with its
//! content and two circular actions inside the pill's trailing edge.
//!
//! Native, not web content, for the same pinned reason the nav bar is: chrome
//! rendered inside WebView2 would have to be injected into arbitrary
//! third-party pages, would fight their CSS and z-index, and would put the
//! composer inside the very content it is reporting on.
//!
//! ## Who does what
//!
//! The BAR owns its window, its painting and its hit testing. The PANE owns
//! everything that has to survive the bar — whether the composer is open, and
//! the text itself. That split is not a preference: Mac is explicit that
//! composer contents survive toggling the toolbar closed and open again, and
//! the natural win32 mistake is to keep the buffer in the child window, where
//! it dies with the window. So the buffer lives in `ViewerPane` and this file
//! only renders and edits it (`pane.feedbackText`, `feedbackInsert`,
//! `feedbackBackspace`).
//!
//! ## Which text control this IS
//!
//! A **WebView2 contenteditable** (`ViewerFeedbackWeb.zig` +
//! `viewer_feedback_page.zig`): a second `ICoreWebView2Controller` filling the
//! pill's text rect, created on the first open and destroyed on close. That is
//! D43's answer, taken against its own recommendation, and T934 is where the
//! composer stopped contradicting it. What the engine brings — caret,
//! selection, wrap, undo, clipboard, IME, a screen reader that can read the
//! field — is the whole reason; see that file's header.
//!
//! The **RichEdit below is the fallback**, not the surface. It is still
//! created (hidden) and every message path it owns still works, so a box whose
//! WebView2 environment is missing gets a composer rather than a dead pill; the
//! moment the web view comes up the RichEdit stays hidden and inert. T937
//! retires it once the web surface has soaked. Which one is live is stated in
//! the pane's own stderr on every open, so the answer is never a guess:
//!
//!     viewer feedback composer surface=web|richedit ...
//!
//! ### The RichEdit, as it was
//!
//! A **RichEdit** (`Msftedit.dll`, class `RichEdit50W`) hosted as a child
//! filling the pill's text rect — D43's recommended answer, taken in T635.
//! T634 shipped this file's chrome over a deliberately minimal editing
//! surface (a plain UTF-8 buffer appended by `WM_CHAR`); everything that made
//! that surface a placeholder — no caret, no selection, no clipboard, no undo,
//! no IME — is the control's job now, and the geometry, the paint, the
//! open/close lifecycle and the pane's reflow all survived the swap exactly as
//! that task promised.
//!
//! RichEdit rather than a plain `EDIT` because the composer's end state has
//! image chips and quoted blocks in it (T641, T636), and an `EDIT` carries
//! neither attachments nor per-run formatting. RichEdit rather than a hand-
//! rolled model because caret, selection, word wrap, undo, drag-drop,
//! clipboard and IME composition are things the OS already gets right in cases
//! we would never think to test — and a feedback composer that eats a
//! Japanese user's text is worse than one that looks slightly off.
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! - **The control is the storage; the PANE is still the owner.** RichEdit
//!   holds the text while the composer is open, and every change is mirrored
//!   straight back into `pane.feedbackText()` from `EN_CHANGE`, so the buffer
//!   that has to outlive this window still does. Opening seeds the control
//!   from that buffer.
//! - **RichEdit sends no notifications by default.** Without the
//!   `EM_SETEVENTMASK`/`ENM_CHANGE` in `create`, `EN_CHANGE` never arrives and
//!   the mirror above silently never runs.
//! - **An IME's text never arrives as `WM_CHAR`.** RichEdit inserts it itself
//!   from `WM_IME_CHAR`, so every path that has to run before text lands at
//!   the caret has to list that message too (T642) — `editProc` does. What
//!   that side of the boundary can be proved to do without an installed IME,
//!   and what has to be checked by hand with one, is
//!   `docs/design/windows-parity-ime-manual.md`.
//!
//! Geometry lives in `viewer_feedback_layout.zig`, where it asserts at
//! 1.0/1.25/1.5/2.0 without a window.
