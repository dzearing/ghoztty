//! The GDI half of an icon-button glyph: one function, so the tab strip, the
//! caption and the pane banner cannot draw the same chevron two different
//! ways (T232).
//!
//! Since T497 that one function renders the SYSTEM ICON FONT first — Segoe
//! Fluent Icons (ships with Windows 11), else Segoe MDL2 Assets (ships with
//! Windows 10) — and only falls back to the hand-drawn filled quads when
//! neither face is actually present. The user's report was direct: *"our
//! icons look chunky and don't really feel native to the platform. Chevrons
//! are chunky for example. We should absolutely feel native like it was built
//! by microsoft using their design language."* A 2 DIP filled mark with
//! square-cut ends cannot read like a 1 px Fluent stroke, and no amount of
//! geometry tuning closes that gap — the fix is to draw the same glyphs
//! Windows draws.
//!
//! The quad geometry — and all of its symmetry — stays in `icon_button.zig`,
//! which stays free of OS imports so its assertions run in every app-runtime
//! lane. It is the fallback, and the reason a machine with no icon font gets
//! a slightly heavier chevron instead of a tofu box.
