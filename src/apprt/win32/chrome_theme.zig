//! One resolution site for every flat color the win32 chrome paints (T304,
//! the derivation half of T203).
//!
//! The chrome used to answer these questions three times over, and each
//! answer was invented where it was needed: the tab bar as `background + 20`
//! per channel, `chooser_rows.accent` as the literal `#3D8EF8`, and
//! `ActivityMonitor.COLOR_ACCENT` as a DIFFERENT literal blue. Neither blue is
//! the user's accent, and a per-channel add is not a color system — it clamps
//! toward white on a light background, so the bar, its hover and the active
//! tab converge on the same near-white and the fixed grey text goes
//! illegible.
//!
//! This module answers them once, from two inputs the OS actually has: the
//! color the chrome sits on, and the accent the user picked. Everything else
//! is derived — washes whose DIRECTION follows the background's own luminance
//! (`color_math.wash`), and contrast floors enforced by search rather than by
//! hoping (`color_math.contrastAdjustedTo`).
//!
//! Pure: no `win32.zig` import, so the unit tests run in every app-runtime
//! lane. The live registry read lives in `system_colors.zig`; the surfaces
//! that consume this palette are rewired in T305.
//!
//! Floors, from `docs/design/win32-design-system.md`:
//!   - text                          >= 4.5:1  (WCAG 1.4.3)
//!   - accent, danger, chrome glyphs >= 3.0:1  (WCAG 1.4.11)
