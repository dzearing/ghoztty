//! The machine chooser's session roster: the RPC, the state, and the painting
//! of the detail pane's per-session list (T318).
//!
//! `chooser_sessions.zig` holds everything pure about a roster row — the label
//! ladder, the connectable filter, the badges and the card geometry — and is
//! unit-tested in the none-runtime lane. This file is what that geometry is
//! drawn with, plus the part that cannot be pure: a blocking `LIST_SESSIONS`
//! against the local agent.
//!
//! ## Threading (inherited from T295, non-negotiable)
//!
//! The RPC blocks — dial, request, wait. It runs on a DETACHED THREAD and posts
//! its outcome back to the GUI thread as a `*Result`, which the handler owns
//! from that moment. A reply that lands after its chooser closed FREES what it
//! fetched instead of adopting it, which is why the message lands on the app's
//! message-only window and not on the chooser's HWND: `DestroyWindow` discards
//! a window's queued messages, and a discarded reply would leak a roster and,
//! on the probe path, a whole connection.
//!
//! A failed or slow fetch is a state OF THE REGION — never a modal, never a
//! blocked chooser.
