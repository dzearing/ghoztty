//! A viewer pane: a split-tree leaf that renders CONTENT (a markdown/text
//! file or a website) instead of a terminal. docs/claude/viewers.md's "Viewer Panes"
//! section is the cross-platform contract; this is the win32 half.
//!
//! **The host floor (T373).** The pane owns a `GhozttyViewer` child window and,
//! inside it, an `ICoreWebView2Controller` created asynchronously on the app's
//! ONE shared environment (`webview2.Host`, T372). What lands here is
//! everything that makes a viewer a normal split-tree citizen — bounds,
//! visibility, DPI, focus, dark mode, teardown — plus the native error card it
//! shows when there is no runtime to host. Navigation, the file/web modes, the
//! resource resolver and the IPC constructor are T374/T375/T90e; nothing
//! constructs a viewer from IPC yet.
//!
//! ## Two windows, one pane
//!
//! The pane's own HWND is a plain child window we paint. WebView2 parents its
//! OWN Chromium child windows inside it and paints those itself, so the pane's
//! painting is only ever seen before the controller is up (a background wash)
//! or when it never comes up (the error card). That split is deliberate: the
//! host window exists from the moment the pane does, so the split tree can lay
//! it out, focus it and close it without ever asking whether a browser process
//! happened to start.
//!
//! ## The async chain, and the pane that dies during it
//!
//! Creation is two asynchronous hops — wait for the shared environment, then
//! wait for the controller — and a pane can be closed in the middle of either.
//! Both hops therefore carry a heap-allocated `Pending` token rather than the
//! pane pointer: the pane clears `Pending.pane` on the way out, so a callback
//! that arrives after the pane is gone finds a null and cleans up instead of
//! writing into freed memory. This is the same hazard `Host.drain` guards
//! against from the other side, and it is not theoretical: closing a viewer
//! pane in the first second of its life is exactly what a user does when they
//! open one by mistake.
//!
//! ## DPI
//!
//! `ShouldDetectMonitorScaleChanges` is OFF and the pane pushes
//! `RasterizationScale` itself (T90a design §4). The window already tracks its
//! own DPI and lays panes out in physical pixels under per-monitor-v2, and two
//! sources of truth for scale is how a pane ends up rendering at 1.25 inside
//! bounds computed for 1.0. A child window never receives `WM_DPICHANGED` —
//! the top-level window does — so the scale is re-read from the host window on
//! every bounds sync, which a DPI change always causes.

    // `Navigate`, measured here the hard way (the first version of this section

    // What stands in for a press is an `ExecuteScript` click, and it is a fair
