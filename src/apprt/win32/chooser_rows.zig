//! Pure row model + geometry for the win32 machine chooser's owner-drawn list
//! (T172, the visual half of T140).
//!
//! The chooser used to be a default `LISTBOX` of single-line strings: one
//! full-width system-blue selection bar and "Name  —  host  ·  online" crammed
//! onto one line. Mac's chooser gives every row a real identity — a shape-coded
//! status indicator, a machine glyph, the name, and a dimmed subline — with a
//! rounded accent selection and a hover wash (`MachineChooserView.row(for:)`
//! and `statusIndicator(for:)`).
//!
//! Everything here is platform-free so it runs in the none-runtime test lane:
//! what a row SAYS (title/subtitle/status/glyph) and WHERE its pieces sit inside
//! the row rect. `MachineChooser.zig` keeps the GDI calls that paint them, and
//! since T1008 the selection COLORS live in `list_selection.zig` — they are the
//! platform's answer for every list, not this chooser's — and are re-exported
//! from here so the painter keeps one import.
