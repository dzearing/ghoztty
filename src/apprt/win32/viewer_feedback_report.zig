//! One feedback report, from the composer's text to a folder on disk (T636,
//! the win32 half of Mac's `ViewerFeedbackReport`).
//!
//! The FORMAT is shared with macOS — the queue is drained by one external
//! watcher that must not care which viewer produced a report — so every JSON
//! key below is spelled the way Mac's `JSONEncoder` spells it, camelCase and
//! all, rather than the snake_case this codebase uses for its own on-disk
//! files. That is why the payload structs are a separate layer from `Context`:
//! the wire names are a contract, and a rename that looked like a tidy-up
//! would quietly fork the format.
//!
//! Everything here is pure logic plus plain `std.fs`, so it is unit tested in
//! the `-Dapp-runtime=none` lane like the rest of `apprt/win32`'s pure modules.
//! `ViewerPane.sendFeedback` is the only caller.
//!
//! ## Layout on disk — one self-contained folder per report
//!
//! ```
//! <worktree>/temp/feedback/new/20260809T004912Z-a3f9c2/
//!     report.json
//!     images/image-1.png
//! ```
//!
//! Everything for a submission lives together, so a report can be moved,
//! archived, or handed to an agent as one unit — `move new\<stem>
//! in-progress\<stem>` is a single rename, and the report's image paths are
//! folder-relative so they survive it.
//!
//! ## Atomicity is the load-bearing property
//!
//! The whole folder is built under `temp/feedback/.staging/<stem>` and moved
//! into `new/` with a SINGLE rename, so a watcher scanning `new/` sees either
//! nothing or a complete report. Staging under `temp/feedback/` rather than
//! `%TEMP%` is what keeps it on the same volume: `std.fs.renameAbsolute` is
//! `MoveFileExW` WITHOUT `MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED`, so a cross-volume attempt
//! fails loudly instead of silently degrading into a non-atomic copy loop —
//! which is exactly the failure a watcher would see as a half-written report.
//!
//! ## JSON, not markdown-with-frontmatter
//!
//! The body is free-form multi-line prose. A body containing a `---` line, or
//! a line that looks like `key: value`, breaks naive frontmatter splitting;
//! JSON escapes newlines inside a string and has exactly one parse path in
//! every language. The body VALUE is still markdown, so a watcher that prints
//! `report["body"]` gets a readable document with working image links.
