//! The win32 half of the `ghoztty://` URL scheme (T695) — the Windows
//! counterpart of Mac's `GhozttyURLScheme.swift`. Three jobs, and nothing else:
//!
//!  1. **Registration.** Windows has no `Info.plist`, so the app writes its own
//!     `HKCU\Software\Classes\<scheme>` entry on launch (idempotent, off the
//!     GUI thread) — the per-user hive, never `HKLM`, because Ghoztty installs
//!     per user and a machine-wide association would need elevation.
//!  2. **Activation.** The shell launches the registered command with the URL
//!     as `argv[1]`. That process is not a terminal: it decodes the link,
//!     forwards a `focus` to the running instance over the IPC pipe, reports
//!     anything that went wrong, and exits.
//!  3. **In-app links.** A `ghoztty://` link clicked INSIDE Ghoztty — a pane
//!     banner, a viewer page — is handled in process and never round-trips
//!     through the shell, so it always means "this app" rather than "whichever
//!     build registered the scheme".
//!
//! The grammar, the one-verb threat model and the failure wording live in
//! `apprt/ipc/url_scheme.zig`, shared with the platform-neutral tests.
//!
//! ## Which build registers what
//!
//! A debug build registers `ghoztty-debug://` and a release build registers
//! `ghoztty://`, mirroring the IPC pipe's `-debug` split. That is what keeps a
//! dev build from stealing the user's links: the two schemes are different
//! names, so the shell never has to choose between them. Both spellings still
//! PARSE in both builds — see the shared module.
//!
//! The build-mode split is not enough on its own (T1124). The staging release
//! we build to package a delivery lives at `zig-out-release\bin` INSIDE the
//! checkout, and it is a release build, so launching it once pointed the user's
//! `ghoztty://` links at a scratch directory that ordinary development rebuilds,
//! moves and deletes. So the release scheme carries a LOCATION gate as well: a
//! build whose exe sits under a source checkout (an ancestor directory holding
//! `build.zig`) never claims it. A portable unpack and the installed release are
//! both outside a checkout and register exactly as before — the gate excludes
//! build output, not unusual install locations. Same shape as
//! `PathInstaller`'s canonical-install gate, and the same `force` escape hatch.
//!
//! ## Who shows the failure
//!
//! Whichever process noticed it — but both show the SAME themed
//! `ConfirmDialog` card every other Ghoztty prompt uses (T717). What differs is
//! how a burst of links is coalesced into one dialog, because the two paths can
//! see different things: an in-app click has the app and uses a flag, while
//! every external click is its OWN process here (the Mac's single
//! `application(_:open:)` array has no analog) and so coalesces across
//! processes with a named mutex.
//!
//! The activation process has no `App`, and `ConfirmDialog.show` wants one —
//! but `showStandalone` (T1177) does not: the dialog only ever needed the app
//! for its window-class instance handle. Its scale comes from the primary
//! monitor rather than from an owner window, since an app-less dialog has no
//! owner and centers on that screen.
