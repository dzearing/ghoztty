//!   HWND by this inset so the grid genuinely starts below the strip (Mac

//! - How a table's columns divide the width the PANE has (T123), so the
//!   banner reflows live with the pane instead of wrapping at a fixed cap,
//!   plus the tail-truncation and UTF-16 break math that keeps one long

// dialog: open the banner editor over a banner and the editor's text and
// the banner's text were different sizes.

// So the banner's body IS `type_ramp.body`, and its line box IS the ramp's
// line box. The numbers live here rather than in `BannerOverlay` because
