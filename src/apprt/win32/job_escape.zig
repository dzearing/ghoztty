//! The startup self-escape from a hostile job object (T675).
//!
//! A child joins its parent's Windows job by default, and an app launched from
//! inside a Ghoztty pane is therefore a member of the AGENT's process-global
//! PTY job — created kill-on-close in `src/remote/agent/pty_child.zig`, its
//! handle held by the agent for the agent's entire life. That membership is a
//! standing death sentence with a known executioner: the destructive agent
//! refresh terminates the agent, the agent's death closes the job's last
//! handle, and the job teardown kills every member — including the app that
//! promised the user "your windows will be rebuilt" one dialog earlier. That
//! is the whole T229/T421/T426 family of unexplained mid-refresh deaths
//! (mechanism measured in T268).
//!
//! You cannot leave a job you are already in; the only way out is to not be
//! the process that is in it. So at startup, before any window or IPC endpoint
//! exists, the app asks where it is (`job_object.selfJob`): inside a
//! kill-on-close job, it respawns its own command line through the escape
//! tiers (`job_spawn.spawnEscapedOnly` — breakaway, then the shell-parent
//! hop, then a jobless donor found by enumeration) and exits, and the escaped
//! twin carries on as THE app. This covers
//! every launch path at once — `ghoztty` typed in a pane, the upgrade script's
//! hidden relaunch, a script's `Start-Process` — instead of patching spawn
//! sites one at a time.
//!
//! Deliberate properties:
//!
//! - **One attempt, ever.** The respawn carries `GHOZTTY_JOB_ESCAPED` in its
//!   environment; the twin consumes the variable and never tries again, so a
//!   world where the escape does not work degrades to today's behavior (run
//!   jailed, loudly) rather than to a fork bomb.
//! - **Escaped or nothing.** The respawn uses `spawnEscapedOnly`: if neither
//!   tier gets a child OUT of the job, no child is created and THIS process
//!   keeps running — jailed, with a warning naming the consequence. A twin
//!   jailed right beside us would be a pure loss.
//! - **The command line and environment survive byte-exact.** The twin is
//!   `GetCommandLineW()` verbatim (flags, `-e`, `--config` intact) with our
//!   environment (both parent-hop tiers pass it explicitly; T506's
//!   launched-from-CLI marker and the pane's variables ride along).
//! - **CLI verbs never do this.** The check is gated (in `main_ghostty`) on
//!   there being no `+action`: a verb lives milliseconds, its console wiring
//!   and exit code belong to its caller, and a job teardown is not a hazard it
//!   lives long enough to meet.
//!
//! Known limit: with NESTED jobs, the NULL-handle flags query answers for the
//! FIRST job this process joined, and there is no public API to walk the rest
//! of the chain. A killer job nested inside a benign outer one is therefore
//! not detected — no worse than before this module existed, and not the field
//! shape: a pane shell's one and only job is the agent's PTY job, and the
//! dying app's own diagnostic measured exactly its flags (0x2000, T426/T268).
