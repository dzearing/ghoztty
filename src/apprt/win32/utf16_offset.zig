//! Byte offsets in a UTF-8 buffer ⇄ character indices in a Windows edit
//! control (T648).
//!
//! Pure — bytes in, numbers out, no OS surface — so it is unit tested in the
//! `-Dapp-runtime=none` lane like its siblings.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Every pure module behind the feedback composer works in BYTES, and it is
//! right to: it operates on the pane's UTF-8 buffer, which is also what the
//! report is written from. Every win32 edit message — `EM_EXSETSEL`,
//! `EM_EXGETSEL`, `EM_POSFROMCHAR` — works in UTF-16 CODE UNITS, because that
//! is what a `W` control stores.
//!
//! Those two numbers are the same number **only for ASCII**. `é` is 2 bytes
//! and 1 unit; `世` is 3 bytes and 1 unit; `😀` is 4 bytes and 2 units. The
//! composer used to hand a byte offset straight to `EM_EXSETSEL`, so a quote
//! or an image chip inserted below any non-English text landed short by the
//! accumulated difference — silent corruption of what the user wrote, and
//! invisible to anyone typing plain English.
//!
//! This module is the conversion at that boundary, in both directions. It is
//! the ONLY home for it: the address bar (`ViewerNavBar`) and the banner
//! editor (`BannerDialog`) only ever select all (`EM_SETSEL 0, -1`), so they
//! never compute an offset and never needed one.
//!
//! ## Line endings are already 1:1
//!
//! RichEdit reports a paragraph mark as a bare CR and `readBack` canonicalises
//! it to LF one-for-one (`EM_GETTEXTEX`/`GT_DEFAULT`, never `WM_GETTEXT`,
//! which expands each mark to CR+LF). So a line break is one byte and one
//! unit, and this module has nothing to say about it — it converts encodings,
//! not line endings.
//!
//! ## Malformed input is clamped, never fatal
//!
//! The buffer comes from `utf16LeToUtf8Alloc` and is well-formed, but a
//! composer must not be able to crash on a stray byte. An invalid lead byte is
//! counted as one byte and one unit and the walk carries on; an offset that
//! lands mid-sequence, or past the end, is clamped to the nearest character
//! boundary at or before it. Both directions therefore always answer, and
//! always answer with a boundary.
