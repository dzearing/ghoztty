//! The viewer pane's native table-of-contents card (T160, design P5): an
//! owner-painted child window listing the document's headings, nested by
//! level, with the section being read highlighted as the page scrolls.
//!
//! The Windows port of Mac's `ViewerTOCPanel` + `ViewerSidePanel`. The card
//! chrome IS the banner's glass card (`banner_card.zig` renders the backdrop
//! — T131's port of `GlassCardBackground`), so a TOC card and a banner in the
//! pane next door read as the same component; the row metrics, the selection
//! pill, the gutter⇄overlay switch and the drag-to-resize handle come from
//! `viewer_toc_layout.zig`, where they assert at every scale without a
//! window.
//!
//! ## Who does what
//!
//! The panel OWNS its window, fonts, painting, scrolling, hover, and the
//! resize drag's mouse tracking. The PANE owns the policy: when the card
//! exists, which layout it is in, the width preference, pushing the page
//! gutter, and what a row click means (`tocRowClicked` runs the page's
//! `scrollToAnchor`, which pins the scroll spy — the pin itself lives in
//! `viewer.js` and this side must not fight it; the highlight simply follows
//! the `active` messages the page posts).
//!
//! Heading ids and the active id are BORROWED from the pane's own storage
//! (`ViewerPane.headings` / `active_heading`): everything runs on the UI
//! thread, and the pane rebuilds this panel's rows in the same call that
//! replaces that storage, so no borrow outlives its owner. Row TEXT is
//! converted to UTF-16 once at sync time and owned here — paint runs far more
//! often than headings change.
