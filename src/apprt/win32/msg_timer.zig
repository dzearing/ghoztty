//! Every `SetTimer` id armed on `App.msg_hwnd`, in ONE place (T608).
//!
//! `msg_hwnd` is the app's single hidden message-only window, so every timer
//! on it shares one id space: `SetTimer` with an (hwnd, id) pair that already
//! exists REPLACES the existing timer, and `KillTimer` kills whichever one is
//! there. Two features that pick the same number therefore cancel each other,
//! silently and only when both happen to be live at once.
//!
//! That is exactly what happened: the quick-terminal slide animation and the
//! update balloon's icon-cleanup timer were both id 3, declared in two
//! different files with nothing comparing them. An update notification arriving
//! mid-slide re-armed the id at 10s and stalled the animation, and the
//! cleanup's own tick was then routed to `onAnimationTick`, so the tray icon
//! outlived its balloon.
//!
//! The ids used to be declared across three files. They live here now, and the
//! `comptime` block below fails the BUILD on a duplicate — so the next feature
//! that needs a timer cannot reintroduce the collision by picking a number
//! somebody else already took.
//!
//! Ids on other windows are a different space and do not belong here:
//! `ActivityMonitor` runs its sample timer on its own hwnd, so its id 1 is not
//! a collision with `quit` below.
