//! "Is this one of our windows the ACTIVE one?" — the single reading of
//! activation the win32 apprt is allowed to make (T215).
//!
//! The obvious way to ask is `GetForegroundWindow`, and every site that used
//! to ask it that way was silently always-false on a **background desktop**:
//! one created with `CreateDesktopW` (which is how the acceptance harness runs
//! the GUI without stealing the user's foreground), and equally a locked
//! workstation, a UAC secure desktop or a disconnected RDP session. There is
//! no foreground window at all on such a desktop — the API returns null for
//! every window on it — so a guard written that way stops guarding and starts
//! answering "no", forever, with no error anywhere.
//!
//! T211 found the first instance (`App.performDeferredFocus` dropped every
//! queued focus assert, so keyboard focus could not move between panes at
//! all). T223 then found the way NOT to fix it: waving the guard through
//! unconditionally off the input desktop restored the entire T105 focus
//! live-lock there, 43 focus flips in 3 s. The lesson that module docs exist
//! to keep: `GetForegroundWindow` was a **proxy** for a question that still
//! has an answer off the input desktop, so the fix is to find the proxy that
//! survives — not to conclude the question is moot.
//!
//! That proxy is `GetActiveWindow`, which is scoped to the calling thread's
//! message queue rather than to the input desktop. Every window this app
//! owns lives on the one GUI thread, so off the input desktop it still names
//! exactly one of ours.
//!
//! Two decisions come out of it, and they differ only in what "nothing known"
//! means:
//!
//!   - `isActive` — the *reporting* reading: is this window the one the user
//!     is working in? Used by `+list --json`'s `focused` field, by the IPC
//!     default target, and by the viewer's TOC emphasis. (It also gated the
//!     viewer's nav-bar hover reveal until T1185 removed the peek; the bar is
//!     part of the pane's frame now and consults nothing.)
//!     Unknown ⇒ **false**: never claim focus we cannot prove.
//!   - `shouldForwardFocus` — the *deferred-assert* reading (T211/T223): may
//!     this queued `WM_APP_SETFOCUS` still fire? Unknown ⇒ **true**, because
//!     dropping every assert leaves keyboard focus unable to move at all,
//!     which is the failure T211 was fixed to prevent.
//!
//! On the input desktop both are byte-identical to what shipped before:
//! `foreground == window`, nothing else consulted. That is deliberate — the
//! interactive path is the one the T105 fix was measured on, and this module
//! changes only the desktop where the old answer carried no information.
//!
//! No OS imports, so it unit-tests in the `none` lane (the
//! `split_geometry.zig` pattern); the windowing half is `w32.activation()`
//! in `win32.zig`, which fills the struct by calling the OS.
