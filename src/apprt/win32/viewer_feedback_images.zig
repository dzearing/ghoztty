//! The images a feedback report carries: what the composer stores, how a
//! picture becomes an `[Image #N]` chip in the text, and which chips are still
//! in the report when it is sent (T637, the win32 half of Mac's
//! `NSTextAttachment` chips).
//!
//! Pure — bytes in, bytes out, no OS surface — so it is unit tested in the
//! `-Dapp-runtime=none` lane like its siblings. `ViewerFeedbackBar` splices
//! chips into the composer from what this decides, `ViewerPane` owns the
//! `Store`, and
//! `viewer_feedback_report.zig` writes the files.
//!
//! ## The number is the identity, and it is in the TEXT
//!
//! Mac makes a chip one atomic `NSTextAttachment` — a single `U+FFFC` — and
//! hangs the image off it, so deleting the character deletes the picture from
//! the report. The pane's buffer is plain text, so a chip here is literally the
//! characters `[Image #3]` and the NUMBER is what ties it to a stored image.
//!
//! That makes the two rules Mac states fall out rather than have to be
//! maintained:
//!
//! - **Numbers are stable, never positional.** `next_number` only ever counts
//!   up, so deleting `[Image #2]` leaves 1 and 3 — the sequence has a hole in
//!   it, which is the point. A number always names the same picture.
//! - **What is in the report is DERIVED from the text.** `live` scans the
//!   composer's text for chips and answers with the entries they name, so a
//!   chip the user deleted takes its image out of the report with it and
//!   nothing has to be told about the deletion.
//!
//! A chip the store does not know (`[Image #9]` typed by hand) is left alone —
//! plain text, no link, no entry. And an entry is live at most ONCE: copying a
//! chip does not attach the picture twice, because there is only one picture.
//!
//! ## Atomicity
//!
//! The composer's page holds a chip as one node, so Backspace takes the whole
//! chip rather than eating the `]` and leaving `[Image #3` behind — which would
//! be a chip that no longer parses, i.e. an image silently dropped from the
//! report by a single keystroke (`viewer_feedback_page.zig`, T936).
