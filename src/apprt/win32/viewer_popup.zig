//! Where a viewer pane's `window.open()` / `target="_blank"` request ends up
//! (T163), and how big the window it asked for should be.
//!
//! Pure: no OS imports, so it is checkable in the `none` lane next to the other
//! viewer logic modules. The COM handshake that acts on the answer lives in
//! `ViewerPane.zig`; this file only decides.
//!
//! ## The rule is Mac's, not "adopt everything"
//!
//! The obvious reading of "adopt popups as ghoztty windows" is that every
//! popup becomes one. That is not what ships on macOS, and copying it would be
//! a regression rather than parity: `ViewerView.popupDestination` hands an
//! `http(s)` popup to the **system default browser** and cancels it, because
//! Ghoztty's web view keeps its own cookie store with no relationship to
//! Safari/Chrome/Edge — a site opened here renders logged out and an OAuth
//! popup never completes. Three things keep a popup in Ghoztty instead:
//!
//!   1. a **Cmd-held** click (**Ctrl** here), the deliberate escape hatch — a
//!      CLICK, so it takes a user gesture as well as the key (see `ctrlEscape`);
//!   2. a popup with **no URL** — a bare `window.open()`, where the script goes
//!      on to write into the window it was handed, so there is nothing to give
//!      a browser;
//!   3. a **non-web scheme**, which `ShellExecuteW` would resolve to some
//!      arbitrary registered handler.
//!
//! Cases 2 and 3 are exactly the popups that CANNOT be handed off, which is why
//! v1's unconditional `ShellExecuteW` was not merely "less nice": a bare
//! `window.open()` reached the shell as the literal string `about:blank`, and a
//! `ghoztty-viewer:`-style scheme would have reached whatever claims it.
//!
//! ## `about:blank` is win32's spelling of Mac's `nil` URL
//!
//! `WKUIDelegate` reports `navigationAction.request.url == nil` for a bare
//! `window.open()`; WebView2's `NewWindowRequestedEventArgs.Uri` reports the
//! string `about:blank` for the same call. They are the same event, so they get
//! the same answer here — that mapping is the one place the two platforms'
//! wording differs and it is deliberate, not an accident of parsing.
