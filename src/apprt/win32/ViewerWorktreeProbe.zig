//! Off-UI-thread worktree resolution for one viewer pane (T633; Mac's
//! `ViewerWorktreeCache`, which does the same job on a `DispatchQueue`).
//!
//! The strategy, the cache and the parsing are `viewer_worktree.zig`, which is
//! pure and asserts in the none lane. What lives here is the part that has to
//! touch the OS: spawning `git`, keeping it OFF the message loop, and posting a
//! completion back to the pane's host window.
//!
//! **The git call must never run on the UI thread.** It is a process spawn on
//! every navigation, and the win32 viewer's message loop is the same one the
//! terminal draws on — a 30 ms `CreateProcess` on a back/forward walk is a
//! visible stutter in the pane next door. So the call site is the worker
//! (`work`), and the pane is repainted from the completion (`complete`), which
//! is the only function here the GUI thread runs that touches the answer.
//!
//! Leg 2 of the strategy — a `localhost:PORT` pane's listening process and that
//! process's working directory (T638) — rides the same worker for the same
//! reason: it is a machine-wide TCP table fetch plus a PEB read on an untrusted
//! process. Which is why `kick` plans rather than resolves: `viewer_worktree`'s
//! `plan` settles legs 1 and 3 here (string work) and hands the port to `work`.
//!
//! One worker at a time. A request arriving while one is in flight sets
//! `dirty` and is re-issued from the completion rather than racing a second
//! spawn — a pane can move three times in a second (a link, a redirect, a
//! back), and each move must not cost its own process.
