//! Pure UTF-16 → UTF-8 conversion for win32 control text (T989): the one
//! bounded, non-panicking way to move what `GetWindowTextW` (or any other
//! wide-string API) handed us into a fixed byte buffer.
//!
//! ## Why this is not `std.unicode.utf16LeToUtf8`
//!
//! `utf16LeToUtf8` does NOT check its destination. Its error set covers
//! malformed UTF-16 only — a dangling surrogate half — so the `catch` that
//! every call site here was written with reads like an overflow guard and is
//! not one. When the destination is too small the ASCII fast path writes past
//! the end of the slice and the tail path `assert`s inside `utf8Encode`
//! (`std/unicode.zig:55`): `panic: reached unreachable code` in a Debug build,
//! a silent buffer overrun in a release one.
//!
//! That is not a theoretical edge. The Activity Monitor's filter box read a
//! 256-unit wide buffer into a 128-byte needle, so about 130 typed characters
//! — or one pasted path — took the whole terminal down, every pane in every
//! window with it. UTF-8 needs up to **three bytes per UTF-16 unit** (and a
//! surrogate pair costs four bytes for two units), so a destination sized by
//! what the author expected someone to type is a crash with a threshold.
//!
//! ## What this does instead
//!
//! Convert as much as fits and stop, always on a codepoint boundary: a filter
//! that is too long filters on its first N characters, which is the behavior
//! the truncating call sites already claimed to have. Never a partial UTF-8
//! sequence, never a write past `out`, never a panic — a text field is the
//! last place in the app that should be able to end the process.
//!
//! No OS imports, so it runs in every app-runtime test lane — same deal as
//! `text_search.zig` and `activity_rows.zig`.
//!
//! ## Shared with the agent (T991)
//!
//! `ghoztty-agent` imports this file too (`src/remote/agent/`: holder pipe
//! enumeration, the host name, the single-instance user id, process image
//! names), and its lane runs these tests. It stays here rather than moving to
//! `src/os/` because it is pure and the agent already reaches into
//! `apprt/win32/` for `job_spawn.zig`; what matters is that there is ONE
//! implementation of the bounds rule, not two that can drift.
