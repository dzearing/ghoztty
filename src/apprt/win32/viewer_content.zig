//! File-mode viewer logic: which renderer a location gets, where a page's
//! resource requests are allowed to resolve, and the `window.__viewer` calls
//! that put a file's bytes on screen (T90e, T90a design §5/§6).
//!
//! Everything here is pure — path arithmetic and string building, no OS
//! surface, no filesystem, no COM — so it runs in the none-runtime lane on
//! either seat. `ViewerPane.zig` is the half that touches disk: it asks this
//! module for a CANDIDATE and then decides whether that candidate exists.
//! Splitting it that way is what makes the directory-escape guard testable
//! without staging a hostile file tree on the box.
//!
//! ## The three tiers, and why the guard is lexical
//!
//! Mac's `ViewerSchemeHandler.resolve` answers a page request in three steps:
//! the bundled template/assets directory first (`viewer.html`, `vendor/…`),
//! then the viewed file's own directory (relative images), then an absolute
//! path as written. The first two are guarded against `..` escaping their
//! root; the third is deliberately unguarded because it IS an absolute
//! reference the document asked for.
//!
//! Mac guards by resolving symlinks and prefix-checking the real paths. This
//! port normalizes LEXICALLY instead (`std.fs.path.resolve`, which folds `.`
//! and `..` without touching the disk) and prefix-checks that. The deviation
//! is deliberate and it is the reason this module is pure: the attack the
//! guard exists to stop is a document saying `![](../../../../secrets.txt)`,
//! which is lexical, and a check that needs a live filesystem is a check no
//! unit test ever runs.
