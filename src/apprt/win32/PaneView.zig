//! The win32 split tree's leaf type: a pane is EITHER a terminal or a
//! viewer (`docs/design/viewer-panes-windows.md`; T90a §3, T90c).
//!
//! Before this the tree was `SplitTree(Surface)`, which made "leaf" and
//! "terminal" the same word. Retyping it to `SplitTree(PaneView)` is what
//! lets a viewer be a normal tree citizen — it resizes, focuses, zooms,
//! closes and persists through exactly the same code paths, with no
//! per-action bypass (Mac's `BaseTerminalController` needed one; win32's
//! split management is leaf-kind-agnostic pure Zig, so it does not).
//!
//! Ownership. The tree stores `*PaneView` and drives the SplitTree view
//! protocol (`ref`/`unref`/`eql`) against it, so PaneView carries the
//! reference count the tree manipulates and owns the leaf underneath:
//!
//!   * `.terminal` — the PaneView holds ONE reference on the Surface
//!     (taken in `createTerminal`, released when the PaneView's own count
//!     reaches zero). Surface keeps its own counter so its existing
//!     teardown — hide, deinit, destroy — is unchanged.
//!   * `.viewer` — the PaneView owns the ViewerPane outright.
//!
//! Each Surface keeps a back-pointer to its PaneView (`Surface.pane_view`)
//! so the destroy paths that only have a `*Surface` (IPC registry forget)
//! can still name the leaf.
//!
//! Kind-generic accessors below are what the tree call sites use: layout,
//! visibility, z-order healing and close-intent all work on any pane. The
//! terminal-only ones (`surface()`, `terminal()`) make the narrowing
//! explicit at the sites that genuinely need a terminal.
