//! Git diff viewer panes: what a `git-status:` / `git-diff:<revspec>` location
//! MEANS, which `git` invocations it turns into, how git's answers parse, and
//! the `window.__viewer` calls that put the result on screen (T463).
//!
//! The win32 half of Mac's `ViewerDiffSpec.swift` + the parsing half of
//! `ViewerGit.swift`. Everything here is pure — string arithmetic, argv shaping
//! and JSON building, no process, no filesystem, no COM — so it asserts in the
//! none lane on either seat. `ViewerDiffProbe.zig` is the half that spawns git,
//! and `ViewerPane.zig` is the half that talks to the page.
//!
//! ## The location IS the spec
//!
//! A diff pane's location is a scheme rather than a path, which is what buys
//! every viewer affordance for free: the address bar shows and accepts it,
//! `+list --json` reports it as the pane's `url`, `+reload` re-runs it, and the
//! session manifest restores the pane by re-running it against the origin
//! directory. Two schemes, both typeable by a human:
//!
//! * `git-status:` — the working tree: staged, unstaged and untracked.
//! * `git-diff:<revspec>` — anything git can diff. A range (`a..b`, `a...b`)
//!   goes to git verbatim; a bare revision means THAT COMMIT's own changes,
//!   which is what "show me what changed in <sha>" means to a person; an empty
//!   revspec means "this branch against its default base", resolved at run time.
//!
//! Which repository it applies to is NOT part of it: like a relative `--view=`
//! path, it resolves against `--working-directory` (else the caller's cwd).
//!
//! `cli/view_arg.isDiffView` is the CLI's copy of the classification and is
//! documented as mirroring `ViewerDiffSpec.parse`; it is IMPORTED here rather
//! than repeated, so the CLI that declines to path-resolve a value and the
//! viewer that renders it can never disagree about which values are diffs.
