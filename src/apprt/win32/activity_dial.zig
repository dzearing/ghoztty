//! Activity monitor connection plane: dialing a machine, and letting go of one.
//!
//! Split out of `ActivityMonitor.zig` (T299). Everything with a LIFETIME in it
//! lives here — the dial thread, the metrics subscription, the borrow of a
//! window's live connection, and the teardown that has to undo all three in
//! the right order. This is the part where a mistake leaks a connection or
//! frees a live window's shell, which is exactly why it is worth reading on
//! its own.
//!
//! The rules, all of them enforced below:
//!
//!   * **Unsubscribe before join, join before free.** `teardownSource` drops
//!     the metrics subscription first, then waits for the dial thread, then
//!     frees the connection. Any other order can free memory a thread is still
//!     reading.
//!   * **A borrowed connection is never freed.** `borrowFromWindow` hands back
//!     a connection a WINDOW owns; `releaseBorrowed` gives it back rather than
//!     closing it, and the window's own teardown is what ends it.
//!   * **Bump the serial so a stale dial frees itself.** `resetForNewSource`
//!     takes a new serial; `onDialed` compares the serial it started under and
//!     closes what it was handed if the panel has moved on.
//!
//! The commentary this file inherited from the panel's header says where those
//! rules came from:
//!
//! ## Remote sources (T295)
//! A `.remote` panel samples through a `remote.Connection`, and who OWNS that
//! connection is the whole design (Mac's `RemoteActivityMonitor.swift:8-16`):
//!
//! - **Dialed** (the chooser's Activity button) — the panel dials a fresh relay
//!   connection and owns it, so `close` frees it.
//! - **Reused** (the palette on a remote window) — the panel borrows the
//!   WINDOW's connection and must never free it; closing the panel cannot be
//!   allowed to take that window's session down with it.
//!
//! The dial blocks through a handshake, so it runs on a detached thread and
//! lands via `WM_APP_ACTIVITY_DIALED` on the APP's message-only window, not on
//! the panel's. That is the difference between a result that always arrives and
//! one that Windows silently discards: `DestroyWindow` drops a window's queued
//! messages, so a dial posted to a panel that closes first would leak the
//! connection it just opened. The app's window outlives every panel, and the
//! `(slot, serial)` pair tells it whether the panel that asked is still there.
//!
//! Host CPU% comes from the pushed `metrics` stream, NOT from the snapshot: the
//! agent builds `PROC_SNAPSHOT.host` from a fresh sampler with no prior tick and
//! says so at `agent/server.zig:1607`. Reading that as CPU% would paint a
//! confident flat zero.
