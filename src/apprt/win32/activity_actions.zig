//! Pure action model for the win32 Activity Monitor's process control (T286):
//! the Kill button's label, the confirmation wording, the aggregated failure
//! text, the error banner's dismissal state, the empty-state/badge choice, and
//! the selection pruning that keeps the Kill count honest. No OS imports and no
//! GDI, so it runs in every app-runtime test lane — the same split that keeps
//! `activity_rows.zig` testable while `ActivityMonitor.zig` owns the HWNDs.
//!
//! The Mac original is `RemoteActivityMonitorView.swift`: the Kill button and
//! its label at :940-952, `killConfirmTitle` at :740-746, the confirmation
//! message at :777-779, the aggregated failure strings in `killSelected` at
//! :587-596, the spawn failure at :627, the "Couldn't connect" empty state at
//! :1034-1045, the "Refresh failed" badge at :919-923, and the selection prune
//! at :1050-1056. Every derivation cites the line it mirrors, because a parity
//! claim that is not anchored to a Mac source line is a guess (the T240 lesson).
//!
//! ## The one deliberate divergence: the confirmation wording
//! Mac says "This sends a termination signal to the process." Windows has no
//! such signal — `proc_control.killWindows` is `TerminateProcess`, which is
//! immediate and ungraceful (that module's own "TERM==KILL" caveat). Repeating
//! Mac's sentence here would MISREPRESENT what the button does, so the Windows
//! body says what actually happens. The task file calls this out by name.
