//! Filing one feedback report, off the UI thread (T636; Mac's
//! `ViewerView.writeFeedback`, which does the same job on a
//! `DispatchQueue.global`).
//!
//! The FORMAT, the source-line resolver and the staging+rename publish are
//! `viewer_feedback_report.zig`, which is pure and asserts in the none lane.
//! What lives here is the part that has to touch the OS: two `git rev-parse`
//! spawns, reading the source file, writing the folder, and posting a
//! completion back to the pane's host window.
//!
//! ## Why a worker at all, for one click
//!
//! Sending is user-initiated and the report is a few kilobytes, so the write
//! itself would be unnoticeable. The REVISION is not: `git rev-parse` is a
//! process spawn, and the viewer's message loop is the same one the terminal
//! next door draws on — the rule `ViewerWorktreeProbe` states ("the git call
//! must never run on the UI thread") is about which loop is blocked, not about
//! how often. Reading the quoted file is the same argument with a size on it: a
//! multi-megabyte document is a real read.
//!
//! ## Why the revision is resolved HERE and not on the worktree probe
//!
//! The probe answers "which repo is this pane's content in", and it caches that
//! for 15 seconds because it is asked on every navigation. A revision cached
//! the same way would be as old as the pane: a viewer left open all day, with
//! branches switched under it, would file a report naming the branch it was
//! opened on. `worktree.path` is a fact about the pane; `branch`/`commit` are
//! facts about the MOMENT the user pressed send, and Mac resolves them at send
//! time for exactly that reason. So the argv+parse halves live in the pure
//! `viewer_worktree.zig` beside the root query (where they assert without a
//! process), and the CALL is here.
