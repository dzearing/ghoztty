//! Z-order policy for the win32 layered overlays — the banner strip
//! (`BannerOverlay`), the dim overlay (`DimOverlay`), the themed scrollbar
//! (`Scrollbar`), the read-only badge, the key-state indicator, the
//! hovered-URL bubble (`Surface.setMouseOverLink`, T180) and the resize
//! overlay (`Window.showResizeOverlay`). All of
//! them are `WS_POPUP` windows owned by the pane/window they decorate, which
//! is what keeps them glued above the terminal content: Windows never lets
//! an owned window sink below its owner, so the *relative* ordering is an
//! invariant we get for free.
//!
//! What ownership does NOT give us is anything about the windows in between.
//! Two ways an overlay ends up floating over OTHER applications, both of
//! them permanent until something re-places the popup — and until T142
//! every reposition said `SWP_NOZORDER`, i.e. "don't touch the z-order":
//!
//!   1. A stray `WS_EX_TOPMOST`. We never set it on an overlay, but any
//!      other process can (T142: a T131 verification probe did exactly that
//!      and never put it back, so for the rest of the day the banners of
//!      background windows sat over whatever was in front).
//!   2. Simply being SHOWN while its owner is not in front. `SWP_SHOWWINDOW`
//!      lifts a popup to the top of the non-topmost band, above unrelated
//!      windows — and it stays there. This one needs no stray probe at all,
//!      and it is measurable at baseline: `overlay-zorder.ps1` found a
//!      freshly-set banner on a BACKGROUND window sitting above the
//!      foreground window of the same app.
//!
//! So a reposition now re-checks both and heals them
//! (`win32.healOverlayZOrder` + `seatedAboveOwner`). The topmost check is
//! owner-RELATIVE, which is the subtlety: an overlay is *supposed* to be
//! topmost when its owner is, because Windows propagates the bit to owned
//! windows. That happens for real — `toggle_window_float_on_top`
//! (`App.zig`) and the quick terminal both make a window topmost — so
//! "clear the bit whenever we see it" would drop the banner out of the
//! topmost band and hide it behind its own window. Only an overlay that is
//! topmost while its owner is NOT is a stray.
//!
//! THE SET IS CLOSED (T721). Every `WS_POPUP` under `src/apprt/win32` has a
//! verdict now, so the next reader does not have to re-derive one:
//!
//!   - HEALED, the list at the top of this doc: banner strip, dim overlay,
//!     themed scrollbar, read-only badge, key-state indicator, hovered-URL
//!     bubble, resize overlay, drop highlight. All passive
//!     (`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`), all decorations of a pane or window, all able to
//!     be visible while their owner is in the background — which is the whole
//!     defect.
//!   - NOT HEALED, and must not be: the find bar (`Surface.ensureSearchBar`)
//!     and the command palette (`Surface.ensureCommandPalette`). These are
//!     ACTIVATABLE popups — no `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`, `SW_SHOW` activates them,
//!     focus goes into their own EDIT — and both DISMISS THEMSELVES the
//!     instant activation leaves them (the palette on `WM_ACTIVATE`/
//!     `WA_INACTIVE`, the find bar on `EN_KILLFOCUS` of its edit, both in
//!     `App.zig`). A popup that cannot be visible while its owner is in the
//!     background cannot reach either case above, so the heal would be dead
//!     code rather than a fix. Measured, not assumed: section I of
//!     `test\win32\overlay-zorder.ps1` drives both, and its I3 arm shows a
//!     stray topmost surviving a close/reopen and the popup dismissing anyway.
//!   - NOT HEALED, and topmost ON PURPOSE: the screenshot region selector
//!     (`RegionSelector`). It is a full-desktop modal gesture that asks for
//!     `WS_EX_TOPMOST` itself and takes the keyboard (Escape cancels), and it
//!     lives only as long as the drag. Healing it would demote the one popup
//!     whose whole job is to be above everything.
//!   - NOT OURS: the tooltips (`ViewerNavBar`, `ViewerFeedbackBar`,
//!     `KeyStateIndicator`, `Window`) are system `TOOLTIPS_CLASS` windows the
//!     OS places and tears down itself, and the modal dialogs
//!     (`ConfirmDialog`, `RenameDialog`, `MachineChooser`, `HostSettingsDialog`,
//!     `NewProcessDialog`, `BannerDialog`, `AgentIntegrationsDialog`,
//!     `UpdateProgress`) are activated top-levels with a caption. Nor are the
//!     app's own top-levels (`Window.zig`), one of which — the quick terminal —
//!     is a frameless `WS_POPUP` in its own right. None of these decorates
//!     anything, so there is no owner to be seated above.
//!   - NOT PRODUCT: the `WS_POPUP` fixtures inside `BannerOverlay`'s own tests
//!     and `class_redraw.measureResize`, which exist for the length of a test.
//!
//! A `grep WS_POPUP src\apprt\win32` is the sweep that produced that list; run
//! it again and every hit should land in one of the buckets above.
//!
//! No OS imports, so this unit-tests in every app-runtime lane (the
//! `split_geometry.zig` pattern); the windowing half is `healOverlayZOrder`
//! in `win32.zig`.
