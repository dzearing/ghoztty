//! The feedback composer's page: the document it loads, the messages that
//! cross the boundary in both directions, and nothing that needs a browser
//! (T934).
//!
//! Everything here is pure, so the whole protocol is unit-testable in the
//! `none` lane without a WebView2 anywhere near it — which matters more for
//! this control than for most, because the browser half only exists on a box
//! with a runtime installed and the acceptance script cannot read a rendered
//! caret.
//!
//! ## Why a page at all
//!
//! D43 was answered with "a second WebView2 controller hosting a
//! contenteditable" rather than the recommended RichEdit, and T830 recorded
//! the design: the pill's TEXT RECT becomes web content while the pill, its
//! accent, the carousel and the send row stay native. This module is the
//! contract between those halves.
//!
//! ## The one rule about numbers
//!
//! No size, no color and no font is written in the stylesheet. They arrive as
//! CSS custom properties in a `vars` message, computed from
//! `viewer_feedback_layout.zig` and `type_ramp.zig` — the modules that already
//! own the design system and already assert at 1.0/1.25/1.5/2.0. That is D43's
//! own mitigation ("one shared source for the design numbers"), and the reason
//! `Vars` carries CSS pixels rather than physical ones: the controller
//! rasterizes at the pane's scale, so a CSS pixel IS a DIP and the conversion
//! happens once, here, instead of in a stylesheet nobody can test.
