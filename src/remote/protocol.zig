//! Wire protocol for the remote-machines feature (WP1).
//!
//! This module is **pure and dependency-free** (only `std`) so it can be unit
//! tested standalone with `zig test src/remote/protocol.zig` and shared verbatim
//! by the client (`src/remote/connection.zig`, WP3) and the agent
//! (`src/remote/agent/`, WP2). It defines:
//!
//!   - The versioned `HELLO` handshake (proto version / transfer encoding /
//!     capabilities) negotiated before any other frame (§4.2).
//!   - The binary frame header `len u32 BE | type u8 | channel u128 | seq u64 |
//!     payload` and every frame type from the §4.2 table.
//!   - Two independent sequence spaces (§4.2 "per m2"): a per-connection frame
//!     `seq` (loss/RTT detection) carried in the header, and a per-channel raw
//!     `byte_offset` carried in the `DATA` payload header (resync anchoring,
//!     §7.3).
//!   - The CR/LF-immune transfer encodings (COBS and base64) used on a Windows
//!     hop because `ssh-shellhost.exe` may mangle CR/LF (§4.2, Win32-OpenSSH#1256),
//!     each enforcing a hard cap on the *decoded* length so a tiny frame can't
//!     expand into an allocation bomb (§15 NEW-3).
//!   - A streaming `Reader` that handles partial/short socket reads and treats
//!     **all** inbound bytes as untrusted (§15 M3): every `len` is bound-checked,
//!     unknown frame types are rejected, and malformed transfer encodings error
//!     out rather than panic.
//!   - The JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope (§9.5) and `FLOW` primitives (§4.3/§4.4).
//!
//! What this module does NOT do: it does not validate channel/session *ownership*
//! (whether an inbound `channel` belongs to a session this client opened — that is
//! connection state, §15 M3) and it does not interpret terminal escapes (that is
//! the VT parser, §9.8). It only frames bytes and bounds them structurally.
//!
//! ## Compatibility history (the agent contract's version log)
//!
//! The `ghoztty-agent` outlives the app, so a running agent is frequently a
//! DIFFERENT build than the app talking to it (see docs/claude/sessions.md, "Agent contract &
//! upgrade compatibility"). Every wire evolution is therefore recorded here, so
//! the compatibility matrix is checkable in review rather than inferred from
//! `git log`. `proto_version` is bumped only for a BREAKING change; everything
//! below rides version 1 and is negotiated additively as a `capability` string
//! (see `capability` and `negotiate`).
//!
//! | Since | Capability | What it added | Absent ⇒ |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | v1 | `resync` | sequence-anchored resync + grid snapshot (§7.3) | no resync |
//! | v1 | `flow` | per-channel flow control (§4.3) | unbounded writes |
//! | v1 | `rpc` | JSON-RPC control plane (§9.5) | no in-pane RPC |
//! | v1 | `tunnel` | port-forward tunneling (§8) | no tunnels |
//! | v1 | `close_session` | `CLOSE_SESSION` 0x2c (kill by session id) | channel-scoped `close` only |
//! | v1 | `grid_snapshot` | visible-screen repaint appended on ATTACH | ring-only replay |
//! | v1 | `grid_scrollback` | that repaint carries scrollback; no raw ring replay | screen-only repaint + ring replay |
//! | v1 | `session_cpu` | pushed per-session CPU 0x79-0x7b | chooser shows no meter |
//! | v1 | `sessions_push` | pushed session roster 0x7c-0x7d | client polls `LIST_SESSIONS` |
//! | v1 | `cpu_units` | `cpu_pct` carries CORRECTED units everywhere | `% CPU` marked unverifiable |
//! | v1 | `session_busy` | pushed `META{has_descendants}` per session | close always confirms |
//! | v1 | `open_failed` | `OPEN_FAILED` 0x06 (refused OPEN, with a reason) | silence ⇒ client times out |
//! | v1 | `attach_failed` | `ATTACH_FAILED` 0x07 (ATTACH the agent cannot answer) | silence ⇒ client times out |
//! | v1 | `repaint_data` | `DATA_REPAINT` 0x15 (injected repaint, advances no offset) | repaint counted as stream bytes |
//! | v1 | `relaunch_notice` | `RELAUNCH.notice` spliced into the replay stream | viewer injects it locally (races the child) |
//!
//! Two rules make that table load-bearing rather than decorative:
//!
//!   1. **New capabilities only ever describe ADDITIVE behavior**, so an older
//!      peer that never advertises one degrades to the "Absent ⇒" column — never
//!      to garbled output, a wedged socket, or a crash.
//!   2. **A capability may also pin the MEANING of an existing field**, not just
//!      the existence of an opcode. `cpu_units` is the first of that kind: the
//!      field `Proc.cpu_pct` predates it, but its VALUE changed (macOS mach ticks
//!      were being read as nanoseconds, ~24× low on Apple Silicon), and a value
//!      that silently changes meaning is exactly what the contract forbids
//!      shipping ungated.
//!
//! Not everything additive needs a capability. An optional HELLO FIELD that
//! gates no opcode and changes no existing value's meaning is safe on its own,
//! because an older peer simply omits it and `ignore_unknown_fields` swallows it
//! in the other direction: `hostname`, `build_version` and `pty_flavor` (T471)
//! are all of that kind. Each states its "absent ⇒" on the field itself.
