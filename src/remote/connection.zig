//! Client-side `RemoteConnection` transport core (WP3, increments 1 + 2).
//!
//! Increment 2 layers **health & link-state tracking** on top of the increment-1
//! transport (§5.1/§5.2/§6.4): a heartbeat driver thread (PING/PONG with RTT
//! sampling per RFC 6298), a pure `LinkState` FSM that *decides* when to
//! reconnect (with full-jitter backoff), a pure `RttEstimator`, internal
//! handling of `.ping`/`.pong`/`.detached` control frames, a reader-exit
//! signal that drives the FSM on a non-deliberate EOF, and observability
//! (`state`/`latencyMs`/`setStateHandler`). It does NOT perform a real
//! reconnect (re-dialing streams + re-handshake + re-ATTACH) — that is the next
//! increment; the FSM only computes the decision and the backoff delay.
//!
//! This is the byte-pump that sits between the two SSH channels of one remote
//! connection (§4.3: a *control* channel and a *data* channel, each a separate
//! SSH-level lane riding the shared `ControlMaster` TCP connection) and the
//! per-pane inbound rings (`inbound_ring.zig`, §3.4). It owns the §3.4 thread
//! topology *minus* the per-pane IO threads:
//!
//!   - **One MPSC writer thread** owns both sockets. N pane IO threads (and the
//!     control plane) concurrently `enqueue` frames; the writer drains them,
//!     assigns the per-connection frame `seq` (§4.2), transfer-encodes via
//!     `protocol.writeFrame`, and writes each to its channel's stream. Preserves
//!     the §3.4 "mux thread owns the socket" invariant.
//!   - **Two reader threads**, one per SSH channel. Each owns its own
//!     `protocol.Reader` and scratch buffer. The *data* reader demuxes inbound
//!     `DATA` into the per-channel rings via `ring.ChannelTable.pushTo` (a
//!     non-blocking push under the table lock — the §3.4 use-after-free guard).
//!     The *control* reader performs the HELLO handshake first, then dispatches
//!     control frames to a registered handler.
//!
//! What this increment does NOT do (deferred to later increments, §5.1): the
//! reconnect/attach state machine, heartbeat/RTT tracking (PING/PONG timing),
//! the steal epoch, `FLOW{pause/resume}` emission on backpressure, and any
//! session/channel *ownership* validation. It is purely the transport: frames
//! in, frames out, demuxed correctly, with a clean handshake and a deadlock-free
//! shutdown.
//!
//! ## Transfer-encoding decision (§4.2)
//! The transfer encoding is **fixed at `create` from `local_hello.transfer_encoding`
//! and used for EVERY frame, including the HELLO itself**. The client picks the
//! encoding (it is the side that knows whether the hop is a CR/LF-mangling Windows
//! hop, §4.2); the agent echoes the same encoding in its HELLO. `protocol.negotiate`
//! therefore only *confirms* agreement — it never switches an in-flight stream to a
//! different encoding. Both `protocol.Reader`s and the writer use this one encoding.
//!
//! Standalone-testable: `zig test src/remote/connection.zig` drives the whole
//! transport over an in-memory loopback (no real ssh) with a mock agent thread.
