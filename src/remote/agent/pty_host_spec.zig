//! The **spawn spec** an agent hands a per-session ConPTY holder (T905,
//! increment 2 of the T705 non-destructive agent upgrade — design:
//! `docs/design/agent-nondestructive-handoff.md`).
//!
//! A holder must reproduce EXACTLY what the in-process `PtyChild` would have
//! spawned: the same shell resolution, the same explicit `argv` rewrite (the
//! shell-integration path, T151), the same forwarded `OPEN.env` allowlist, the
//! same `TERM`, the same cwd. That is `protocol.Open` — the struct the app
//! already sends — so this spec carries `Open` VERBATIM rather than restating
//! it flag by flag. Nothing can drift between what the agent was asked for and
//! what the holder spawns, because it is the same value.
//!
//! ## Why a file and not argv or the environment
//!
//! - **argv**: `OPEN.env` values and an explicit `argv` are arbitrary user
//!   strings (paths with spaces, quotes, `%` and `^`), and a Windows command
//!   line is one string with a 32 KiB ceiling. Every one of those is a quoting
//!   bug waiting for the one user whose value contains a `"`.
//! - **the environment**: the holder must ESCAPE the agent's kill-on-close job,
//!   and the escape's second tier spawns with a spoofed parent, which donates
//!   the *caller's* environment block. Per-session variables set on the agent
//!   to reach one holder would leak into the next.
//!
//! A file sidesteps both: JSON in, JSON out, no escaping rules. It lives in the
//! user's TEMP directory (per-user, ACL'd by Windows to that user) for the few
//! milliseconds between the agent writing it and the holder reading it —
//! `readAndDelete` unlinks it before the shell is spawned, so a spec carrying
//! forwarded env never outlives the spawn it configures.
//!
//! Layering: pure — `std` + `protocol` only — so the round-trip, the version
//! gate and the unknown-field tolerance all run in the `test-agent` lane on any
//! host.
