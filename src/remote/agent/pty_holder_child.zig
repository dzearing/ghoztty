//! The agent's **owner side** of a per-session ConPTY holder (T905, increment 2
//! of the T705 non-destructive agent upgrade — design:
//! `docs/design/agent-nondestructive-handoff.md`).
//!
//! `open()` spawns a holder process (`ghoztty-agent --pty-host --spec <file>`)
//! that ESCAPES the agent's kill-on-close job, dials its control pipe, and
//! hands back a `session.Child`. That is the whole trick: to every other line
//! of the agent — the session store, the ring, `+sessions`, CLOSE, RESIZE,
//! SIGNAL, the exit/tombstone path — a holder-backed session is indistinguish-
//! able from the in-process `PtyChild` it replaces, because it presents the
//! same vtable. Nothing above this file knows a second process exists.
//!
//! What changes is what happens when the AGENT dies: nothing. The ConPTY, the
//! shell and the kill-on-close job all live in the holder, so an agent crash,
//! kill or upgrade leaves the shell running and the holder buffering its
//! output. Picking those survivors back up at the next agent start is T906;
//! this increment's promise is only that they are still there to pick up.
//!
//! ## Threads
//!
//!   - **caller's thread**: `open` (spawn + dial + HELLO + ATTACH), and every
//!     vtable call except output delivery. Frame writes take `write_mutex` so a
//!     keystroke and the reader's ACK can never interleave mid-frame.
//!   - **reader**: one per child. Pumps OUTPUT frames → the session sink,
//!     ACKs what it delivered (releasing the holder's replay buffer), records
//!     EXIT. On an unexpected pipe drop with the holder still ALIVE it
//!     RE-DIALS and re-ATTACHes at the last delivered offset — the protocol's
//!     gap-fill, used in production rather than only in the smoke.
//!
//! ## Failure shapes, and which one is which
//!
//!   - Shell exits → holder sends EXIT → `tryWait` reports the code → the
//!     normal tombstone path. Identical to `PtyChild`.
//!   - Pipe drops, holder alive → transient; re-dial and gap-fill. The session
//!     keeps running; the user sees at most a stall.
//!   - Holder gone → the ConPTY and shell went with it (its own Job Object).
//!     `tryWait` reports the holder's exit code so the session tombstones
//!     instead of hanging alive around a shell that no longer exists.
