//! **Non-destructive agent handoff** (T907, increment 4 of the T705 split —
//! design: `docs/design/agent-nondestructive-handoff.md`).
//!
//! The `ghoztty-agent` outlives the app on purpose, so a delivery swaps
//! `ghoztty-agent.exe` on disk and leaves the RUNNING agent alone. Until now the
//! only two ways to adopt that newer build were both lossy (T662): a silent
//! restart, allowed only at zero live sessions — a box with one always-open pane
//! never reaches it — or a mandatory dialog that closes every session. On a
//! long-lived box the agent simply stayed old.
//!
//! With per-session holders (T904–T906) the shell, its ConPTY and its
//! kill-on-close job live OUTSIDE the agent, so replacing the agent costs
//! nothing. This module is the replacement act:
//!
//! ```
//!   old agent ──spawn(newer exe, --handoff-successor=<private pipe>)──► successor
//!             ◄─────────────── READY <pid> <stamp> ────────────────────
//!             ───── snapshot rings + persist, then GO ────────────────►
//!             ──── exit(0): every holder is released, nothing killed
//!                                                       successor takes the
//!                                                       guard + public pipe and
//!                                                       re-adopts the holders
//! ```
//!
//! ## "Never neither"
//!
//! The old agent gives up NOTHING until the successor has proven it started: it
//! keeps its listener, its guard and its holder connections right up to the GO.
//! Every failure before that point — the exe would not spawn, the successor died
//! on startup, it never answered, it answered with the wrong build — ends with
//! the successor terminated and the old agent still serving, exactly as it was.
//! The successor, for its part, binds nothing public and takes no guard until it
//! has been told GO, so the two can never both be listening either.
//!
//! The one window that exists by construction is between GO and the successor's
//! bind: for a few milliseconds no agent owns the public pipe. That is the same
//! link drop the app's in-place recovery already handles (T145/T723), and the
//! sessions are in holders throughout, so it costs a reconnect and nothing else.
//!
//! ## Who decides
//!
//! The agent does, on its own supervisor thread. The alternative — the app asks
//! it to — was rejected: the agent is the only side that knows which sessions are
//! holder-backed, it needs no new wire opcode to act on what it knows, and it
//! must work with no app running at all (the unattended morning refresh, T525,
//! deliberately never touches the agent). The app's half is only to STAND DOWN,
//! which is what `capability.agent_handoff` negotiates.
//!
//! ## Mixed generations drain lazily
//!
//! A legacy session — one whose ConPTY the agent itself owns, because it predates
//! holders or was opened with the holder path off — cannot be carried across a
//! process boundary at all (the HPCON wall, see the design doc). So the handoff
//! WAITS: while any live session is legacy the supervisor does nothing but say
//! so, and the count is reported through `+sessions --agent`. Every such session
//! that closes brings the box one step closer; the forced path remains the
//! existing explicit confirmation the app offers.
