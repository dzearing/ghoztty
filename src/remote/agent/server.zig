//! Agent session-server core (WP2, increment 1) — the remote-host side of the
//! remote-machines wire protocol. It is the **symmetric peer** of the client
//! `src/remote/connection.zig`: where the client opens/attaches and renders, the
//! agent spawns/owns the child processes and streams their output back.
//!
//! Scope of THIS increment (§4.1–4.2 bootstrap/handshake, §7.1 session model):
//!
//!   - Read the client HELLO on control, reply with the agent HELLO echoing the
//!     pinned `transfer_encoding`, confirm via `protocol.negotiate` (§4.2).
//!   - A serialized MPSC writer thread that frames via `protocol.writeFrame` onto
//!     the correct channel (control vs data), assigning the per-connection
//!     `FrameSeq` at send time so seq order == wire order (mirrors the client).
//!   - A control reader thread that handshakes then dispatches every inbound
//!     control frame, and a data reader thread that routes inbound DATA to the
//!     owning session's child (keystrokes).
//!   - Frame handling: OPEN→OPENED + live DATA streaming; client DATA→child;
//!     ATTACH (alive/dead/not_found) with a byte-offset-anchored snapshot;
//!     RESIZE/SIGNAL/DETACH/CLOSE; EXIT-after-final-DATA on child exit; PING→PONG;
//!     FLOW pause/resume gating.
//!
//! Untrusted input (§15 M3): `protocol.Reader` bounds every frame; we additionally
//! validate session/channel **ownership** (an inbound channel must belong to a
//! session this connection opened) — unknown ids/channels are ignored, never a
//! crash.
//!
//! ## Stubbed vs real (increment 1)
//!
//!   - **Transport** (`Stream`): abstract vtable; tests drive it over an in-memory
//!     loopback. Real impl wraps the two ssh-channel pipe fds — out of scope.
//!   - **Child**: abstract (`session.Child`); the real pty/ConPTY impl is
//!     `pty_child.zig` (wired in `main.zig`), while tests inject a fake,
//!     pipe/buffer-backed child.
//!   - **Snapshot**: `ATTACHED.snapshot_at_offset` is the session's current
//!     outbound offset `S`; reconnect replays the ring forward from there. A true
//!     grid-model snapshot at `S` (§7.3), so ring eviction is invisible, is
//!     future work.
//!   - RPC, tunnels: out of scope.
//!
//! ## Driving it (test harness pattern)
//!
//!   var server = try Server.create(alloc, control_stream, data_stream, .{...});
//!   try server.start();                 // spawns writer + 2 readers
//!   _ = try server.waitHandshake();     // blocks until HELLOs exchanged
//!   ... a mock client drives frames over the loopback ...
//!   server.shutdown();                  // unblocks + joins all threads
//!   server.destroy(alloc);
//!
//! ## Running the tests
//!
//! These modules import `../protocol.zig` relatively (the same path the real
//! `zig build agent` graph uses). A `zig test` rooted at this file's directory
//! can't reach `../protocol.zig` ("import outside module path"), so root the test
//! one level up via the aggregator `src/remote/agent_test.zig`:
//!
//!   zig test -Mroot=src/remote/agent_test.zig
//!
//! The real build wires the agent exe via `build.zig` (`zig build agent`).
