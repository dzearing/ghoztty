//! Agent-side session model (WP2, §7.1) — the remote-host counterpart to the
//! client's `Pane`/`Channel`. A `Session` ties a spawned child process to one
//! data channel, tracks its dimensions / cwd / title / activity state, retains a
//! bounded **raw-output ring** (recent scrollback for sequence-anchored resync,
//! §7.3), and owns the per-channel outbound `ByteOffset` that anchors every
//! child→client `DATA` frame.
//!
//! This module is deliberately transport-agnostic: it knows nothing about
//! `Stream`, framing, or threads. The `Server` (`server.zig`) drives it. The only
//! cross-module dependency is `protocol.zig` (the pure wire contract) — so this
//! file unit-tests standalone.
//!
//! ## Child abstraction
//!
//! A `Child` is an interface (vtable) over "a process attached to a pty". The
//! real implementation is `pty_child.zig` (POSIX pty via `src/pty.zig`, Windows
//! ConPTY), wired into every production serve path in `main.zig`; a fake,
//! buffer-backed child is used only by the tests. The vtable seam means the
//! `Server` is identical for both.
//!
//! ## Real vs. a known limitation
//!
//!   - Session table, ids, caps, tombstones, ring, byte-offset: **real**.
//!   - Child process: **real** (`pty_child.zig`); tests inject a fake.
//!   - Idle-TTL / ring-memory GC: **real** — the background reaper
//!     (`startReaper`) evicts orphaned sessions past `default_idle_ttl_ms`.
//!   - Grid snapshot for resync: **known limitation** — `snapshotOffset()`
//!     anchors the current outbound offset `S` and reconnect replays the ring
//!     forward from the client's last offset (byte-exact within the ~2 MB ring;
//!     deeper scrollback is dropped with a visible marker). A true grid-model
//!     snapshot at `S` (§7.3), so eviction is invisible, is future work.
