//! `ghoztty-agent` entry point (WP2, §4.1–§4.2/§7.1) — the remote-host daemon.
//!
//! Four transport modes share the SAME session-server core (`server.zig`, real
//! pty-backed children via `pty_child.zig`) and the SAME lane mux (`mux.zig`):
//!
//!   1. **stdio** (`--stdio`, or the default when stdin is not a tty / no listen
//!      addr): read framed protocol from stdin, write to stdout. This is the
//!      `ssh host -- ghoztty-agent` path (§4.1). One stdin/stdout pipe pair, both
//!      logical lanes muxed onto it. Shuts down on stdin EOF (client hung up).
//!
//!   2. **TCP listen daemon** (`--listen <addr:port>`, loopback by default;
//!      non-loopback needs `--insecure-allow-public`): bind, listen, then loop —
//!      accept a connection and serve it on its OWN thread (a `Mux` + `Server`
//!      over the socket, sharing the daemon-scoped session store), so the accept
//!      loop NEVER blocks on one connection's lifecycle. UNAUTHENTICATED — a
//!      local/dev harness only (the authenticated path is `--relay`).
//!
//!   2b. **Unix-socket listen daemon** (`--listen-unix <path>`, POSIX-only): the
//!      SECURE local transport for session persistence (design §5.2). Same
//!      accept→serve→loop core as the TCP path, but bound to a 0600 AF_UNIX
//!      socket (created that way race-free via umask) and gated with a
//!      per-connection `getpeereid` same-uid check — so, unlike a 127.0.0.1 TCP
//!      port that ANY local uid can connect to, only this user can reach the
//!      shell. A stale socket node from a prior run is unlinked only after a
//!      connect-probe confirms nothing live is listening. This is what the macOS
//!      app spawns for local persistent windows (Windows uses 2c below).
//!
//!   2c. **Named-pipe listen daemon** (`--listen-pipe <\\.\pipe\name>`,
//!      Windows-only, T89c): the SECURE local transport on Windows — the same
//!      accept→serve→loop core, bound to a named pipe created with an
//!      owner-only DACL (the stand-in for 2b's same-uid peercred gate) +
//!      PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS. FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE makes the
//!      bind double as the stale/live probe (a dead holder's pipe name simply
//!      stops existing). This is what the Windows app spawns for local
//!      persistent windows.
//!
//!   3. **Relay daemon** (`--relay <url>`): the single-binary rendezvous path (no
//!      Go sidecar, no inbound port). Hold an authenticated `wss://` control
//!      WebSocket to the relay; on each `{"type":"open","session":S}` command,
//!      dial a per-session data WebSocket and serve it over the SAME `serveOne`
//!      core (shared store) as an accepted socket. The device token is read from
//!      `GHOSTTY_DEVICE_TOKEN`, falling back to the agent's persisted
//!      `relay.env` (see `enroll.zig`); relay.env is then WATCHED so a
//!      re-enroll's new token is adopted without a restart (`relay_creds.zig`).
//!      With NO credential anywhere, an interactive (non-`--headless`) launch
//!      runs the browser enrollment INLINE on first run and then continues into
//!      the connect loop — the MSI Start-Menu / Run-key launch is exactly
//!      `ghoztty-agent --relay=<base>` (see `decideRelayCred`); `--headless`
//!      keeps the explicit "run --enroll first" error.
//!      Reconnects with backoff on a control
//!      drop (sessions survive). Coexists with — does not replace — `--listen`.
//!
//! Plus one one-shot utility mode: `--enroll --relay <url>` runs the OAuth
//! self-enrollment (`enroll.zig`) — opens the owner's browser to approve the
//! sign-in (Tailscale-style), falling back to the device-code "visit URL,
//! enter code" flow when the relay offers no web client or
//! `--no-browser`/`--headless-enroll` is passed — and persists the issued
//! device credential to `relay.env`, after which `--relay <url>` just works.
//!
//! ### SESSION SURVIVAL (P1, §7.1) — the close-laptop scenario
//! The session table + pty children + output rings live in a DAEMON-scoped
//! `SessionStore` that OUTLIVES any connection. When a client disconnects, its
//! per-connection `Server` is torn down but its sessions are merely DETACHed
//! (output keeps flowing into their rings); they are NEVER terminated on a mere
//! drop. A reconnecting client `ATTACH`es by session id with its last byte offset,
//! and the agent replays the ring gap `(last_byte_offset, S]` — catching the client
//! up to everything the remote produced while it was gone — then resumes live
//! streaming. Orphaned sessions are reaped by a background idle-TTL thread
//! (`session.default_idle_ttl_ms`, 24 h — long enough to survive a closed
//! laptop lid overnight) so abandoned shells don't leak forever.
//!
//! ### SECURITY
//! The `--relay` path is authenticated end to end (per-device bearer token, and
//! the relay enforces account ownership). The `--relay` mode is the ONLY way a
//! customer install brings a machine online (the MSI/installer autostart it with
//! `--relay=<url>`).
//!
//! The TCP `--listen` path is **unauthenticated**: any host that can reach the
//! port can open a shell. It exists for local/dev use only and is guarded:
//!   - a bare invocation (no args) does NOT listen — it prints usage and exits;
//!   - `--listen` may bind loopback (`127.0.0.1`/`::1`) freely;
//!   - binding a NON-loopback interface requires the explicit
//!     `--insecure-allow-public` opt-in and prints a loud warning.
//! So an unauthenticated shell can never be exposed to the network by accident.
//!
//! The `--listen-unix` path is the hardened LOCAL alternative: a filesystem
//! socket is never network-reachable, is created 0600 (no group/other access),
//! AND every accepted connection is admitted only if `getpeereid` reports the
//! peer's uid equals ours (an unreadable credential is rejected — a shell is
//! never served to an unauthenticated peer). This is the transport the app uses
//! for local session persistence.
//!
//! ## Transport over a single byte channel
//! The wire design (§4.3) uses two logical lanes — control + data, each a
//! `server.Stream`. Both modes have only ONE underlying byte channel (a pipe pair
//! or a socket), so `mux.Mux` folds both lanes onto it (DATA → data lane, else →
//! control lane). The `Server`'s two reader threads consume their lanes unchanged.
//!
//! ## Deferred (this increment)
//!   - A real grid-model snapshot on ATTACH (§7.3): `snapshot_at_offset` is the
//!     current outbound offset and resync replays the raw ring from there. Exact-
//!     grid reconstruction (so deep-scrollback eviction is invisible) is future.
//!   - Authentication / TLS on the listener (see SECURITY above).
//!   - Daemonization / detach (§4.1). (Single-instance IS enforced: the daemon
//!     modes `--listen`/`--relay` take a per-USER guard — Global\ named mutex
//!     keyed by SID on Windows, flock on POSIX — and a losing instance exits
//!     with code 183 after verifying the holder is alive via its heartbeat
//!     file; a stuck holder is killed and replaced, and `--force-replace`
//!     (alias `--replace`) replaces even a healthy one. See
//!     `single_instance.zig`. `--stdio` and `--enroll` are exempt.)
//!   - RPC, tunnels, multi-client fan-out to one session (§5.3 steal).
