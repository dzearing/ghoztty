//! Startup **re-adoption** of surviving `--pty-host` holders (T906, increment 3
//! of the T705 non-destructive agent upgrade — design:
//! `docs/design/agent-nondestructive-handoff.md`).
//!
//! T905 made a session's ConPTY, shell and kill-on-close job live in a separate
//! holder process, so an agent that dies — crashed, killed, replaced by a newer
//! build — leaves every shell running and its output piling up in the holder's
//! replay buffer. This module is the other half: the first thing a starting
//! agent does with the roster it just loaded from `sessions.json` is find those
//! survivors and plug them back in.
//!
//! ```
//!   sessions.json record ──dial holder_pipe──► HELLO (shell pid, retained
//!                                              window, exit state)
//!                        ──ATTACH(ack)───────► replay of exactly the bytes the
//!                                              on-disk ring snapshot is missing
//! ```
//!
//! What the user sees afterwards: nothing. The pane re-attaches to the same
//! running program, the scrollback has no hole and no restart divider, and the
//! shell pid is the one it was before. A holder that does NOT answer takes the
//! path it always took — the relaunch/tombstone notice — because in that case
//! the shell really is gone.
//!
//! ## Why the ordering is what it is
//!
//! 1. **Adopt, then reap.** The orphan sweep below shuts down holders that no
//!    session record claims. Running it before adoption would let it kill the
//!    very shells we are about to pick up.
//! 2. **Before the listener accepts anybody.** A viewer that ATTACHes to a
//!    holder-backed session mid-adoption would see it as a dead tombstone and
//!    offer a RELAUNCH — which would spawn a SECOND shell beside the running
//!    one. Adoption is finished before the agent serves its first connection.
//!
//! ## The orphan sweep
//!
//! A holder whose session record aged out (`max_unclaimed_restarts`), or that
//! no record ever named, is unreachable forever: no agent will dial a pipe name
//! nothing records, and no viewer can attach to a session that does not exist.
//! Its shell would run until the box rebooted. So after adoption we enumerate
//! the holder pipe namespace and shut down every holder no live session claims.
//!
//! Two properties keep that from being dangerous. The pipe name carries the
//! username AND the build-mode segment, so a debug agent can only ever see
//! debug holders (T350 endpoint isolation). And a holder serves ONE owner at a
//! time — if a connect succeeds, nobody owns it, which is the same fact the
//! sweep is testing for.
