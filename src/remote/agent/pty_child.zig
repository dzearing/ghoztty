//! Real, POSIX-pty-backed `session.Child` (WP2, §4.1–§4.2/§7.1) — the production
//! replacement for the fake buffer-backed child. It is the agent's bridge between
//! a spawned shell/command and the session-server's frame routing:
//!
//!   - `open` opens a pty (`src/pty.zig`), spawns the user's shell on its SLAVE
//!     fds via the GUI-free `CommandCore.DefaultCommand`, and keeps the MASTER fd.
//!   - A reader thread pumps the MASTER fd → the session ring via the `Server`'s
//!     output sink (`onChildOutput`), so child output flows as DATA frames.
//!   - `write` (client keystrokes / inbound DATA) writes to the MASTER fd.
//!   - `resize` drives `TIOCSWINSZ` via `pty.setSize`.
//!   - `signal` maps a POSIX signal name to `kill(2)` on the child's process group.
//!   - `tryWait` is a non-blocking `waitpid(WNOHANG)` → exit code (drives the
//!     existing EXIT/tombstone path); `terminate` SIGKILLs + reaps + joins.
//!
//! Threading: exactly one reader thread per child calls the sink. The `Server`'s
//! `sess_mutex` serializes sink delivery with frame handling (the sink IS
//! `Server.onChildOutput`, which takes that lock). The child is heap-owned by the
//! `PtySpawner` and freed on `terminate`.
//!
//! ## Cross-platform (§13)
//!
//! The OS-specific operations branch on `builtin.os.tag` exactly the way
//! `src/pty.zig` does. On **POSIX** the child runs on a real pty: a forked shell
//! on the SLAVE fds, the MASTER fd pumped/written via `posix.read`/`posix.write`,
//! and signalled via `kill(2)` on the child's process group. On **Windows** the
//! child runs on a **ConPTY** (`WindowsPty`): the shell is spawned with null stdio
//! + `pseudo_console = pty.pseudo_console` (mirrors `src/termio/Exec.zig:1027` and
//! the proven `conpty_smoke.zig`), child output is pumped via
//! `ReadFile(pty.out_pipe)`, input is written via `WriteFile(pty.in_pipe)`, signals
//! map to ConPTY-friendly equivalents (Ctrl-C → `0x03` on the input pipe; kill →
//! `TerminateProcess`), and teardown closes the pty (→ `ClosePseudoConsole`) BEFORE
//! joining the reader so its blocked `ReadFile` EOFs (the smoke's deadlock fix).
//! The public `PtySpawner`/`session.Child` interface is byte-for-byte identical on
//! both — only the internal per-OS syscall arm differs.
//!
//! Deferred (later increments): daemonization, idle-TTL GC, Job/containment caps,
//! a real grid-model snapshot (§7.3). On Windows, Job-Object subtree kill +
//! `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` group signalling are future hardening; this arm uses
//! the simplest robust ConPTY paths (see `spike/FINDINGS.md` §5).

// =============================================================================
// Windows kill-on-close Job Object — no orphaned PTY shells
// =============================================================================
//
// The agent spawns a `cmd.exe` (+ `conhost.exe`) per remote session via ConPTY.
// When the agent process is KILLED (the deploy watcher SIGKILLs the old agent to
// hot-swap a new build, or any crash), those ConPTY children would be ORPHANED
// and survive forever — piling up on the Windows box and exhausting resources.
//
// Fix: a process-global Windows Job Object owned by the agent, created with
// `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. Every per-session PTY child is assigned
// to it right after spawn. The agent holds the job handle for its entire life
// and NEVER closes it — so when the agent process exits for ANY reason (SIGKILL,
// crash, normal), the OS closes the handle, which (because no other handle is
// open) TERMINATES every assigned child. No orphans.
//
// Lifetime correctness:
//   - The job ties child lifetime to the AGENT process, NOT the client. A CLIENT
//     disconnect does NOT kill the agent, so the job stays open and the remote
//     shell SURVIVES for reconnect (§7.1). ✅
//   - `proc_spawn` (Activity Monitor "New Process") children are spawned in
//     `proc_spawn.zig` with `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` and are NEVER assigned to
//     this job, so they intentionally OUTLIVE the agent. ✅
//   - Nested jobs: Windows 8+ allows a process already in a job to be assigned to
//     a nested job, so even if the agent itself is launched inside an outer job
//     (e.g. a deploy harness's job), assigning the ConPTY child here still works.
//     The PTY child is NOT spawned with `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`, so it remains
//     assignable to our job.
//
// Failure handling: if `CreateJobObjectW` / `SetInformationJobObject` /
// `AssignProcessToJobObject` fails (e.g. an OS/policy that forbids it), we LOG
// and continue — the child just isn't job-managed (falls back to today's
// behavior, no crash).
