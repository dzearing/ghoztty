//! Per-channel inbound ring + channel table (WP3 spike, §3.4 mini-spec).
//!
//! This is the one novel concurrency primitive the remote-machines feature
//! introduces, so the design gates it behind its own spike + benchmark before
//! WP3 fans out (§3.4/§17). The problem it solves: a single connection demux
//! thread reads framed `DATA` for N panes off one socket. If it applied each
//! frame inline (as Exec's `ReadThread` does today, `Exec.zig:1358`), a flooding
//! pane would head-of-line-block the quiet panes. The fix:
//!
//!   - One **SPSC byte ring per channel**. The connection's demux thread is the
//!     single *producer*; the pane's own IO thread is the single *consumer*
//!     (which then calls `processOutput` on its own thread, restoring per-pane
//!     parallelism — no cross-pane HOL).
//!   - The producer does a **non-blocking `push`** and is therefore never stalled
//!     by a full ring: on backpressure it sends `FLOW{pause}` for that channel and
//!     keeps servicing the others. The consumer sends `FLOW{resume}` once it has
//!     drained back below the low-water mark.
//!   - A `ChannelTable` (lock-protected) maps `channel_id → *Channel`. The
//!     **lock-ordering teardown invariant** (§3.4): the producer holds the table
//!     lock for the duration of a lookup+push, so a channel can never be freed out
//!     from under a push. Teardown order is *stop consumer → join pane IO thread →
//!     deregister under the table lock → free ring*.
//!
//! This module is standalone-testable (`zig test src/remote/inbound_ring.zig`);
//! it has no dependency on xev or the rest of the termio stack. The real WP3
//! wiring supplies a `Waker` backed by the pane's `xev.Async`; here the stress
//! harness backs it with a `std.Thread.ResetEvent`. The ring stores raw decoded
//! child-output bytes (the same stream the §4.2 `byte_offset` counts).
