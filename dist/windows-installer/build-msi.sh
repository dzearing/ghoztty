#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-msi.sh — build the per-user Windows MSI for the Ghoztty terminal.
#
# Generates a WiX source (wixl/WiX-v3 subset) that packages ghoztty.exe, its
# console twin ghoztty.com, the session-persistence agent and the share/
# resource tree (themes, shell-integration, terminfo sentinel that
# src/os/resourcesdir.zig climbs for), compiles it with wixl (GNOME msitools)
# and validates the result with msiinfo — no Windows box needed.
#
# Usage:
#   dist/windows-installer/build-msi.sh [--version <stamp>] [--build-num <N>]
#                                       [--out <path>] [--skip-build]
#                                       [--semver <X.Y.Z>]
#                                       [--test-identity <Name>]
#                                       [--print-file-version]
#
# Defaults:
#   version    $(date +%Y%m%d)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) build stamp,
#              shown in Apps & Features via ARPCOMMENTS. The numeric MSI
#              ProductVersion is derived as yy.m.dNN (e.g. 26.7.501 =
#              2026-07-05 build 01) so newer builds always compare greater
#              and MSI major upgrades fire.
#   build-num  1 — same-day rebuild counter (bump when publishing twice in
#              a day: same ProductVersion refuses to install over itself).
#   out        zig-out/Ghoztty-<yy.m.dNN>-x64.msi (Ghoztty-<semver>-x64.msi
#              when --semver is given: the release-asset name, T24).
#   --semver <X.Y.Z>  release-channel build (T24): the zig build is stamped
#              with -Dversion-string=X.Y.Z+<short-hash> (so the exe's
#              semver matches the win-vX.Y.Z GitHub release tag the update
#              check compares against) and -Dwindows-update-check=true
#              (enables the in-app update check; dev builds never check).
#   --skip-build  reuse zig-out/bin/ghoztty.exe + zig-out/share instead of
#              running zig build (which needs the zig@0.15 PATH exports).
#              NOTE with --semver the exe must already carry the matching
#              -Dversion-string/-Dwindows-update-check (the on-box publish
#              script builds natively, then runs this under Docker).
#   --print-file-version  print the per-build FILEVERSION (yy.m.d.NN) this
#              run would use and exit, so a caller that builds the exe
#              itself (build-release-artifacts.sh, T38) passes the SAME
#              -Dwindows-file-version instead of restating the formula.
#   --test-identity <Name>  build a THROWAWAY MSI under a distinct product
#              identity (Name, install dir, UpgradeCode, registry key, and
#              component-GUID namespace all derived from <Name>) so on-box
#              install/upgrade/uninstall E2E tests never touch the real
#              Ghoztty product or install dir. Never ship these.
#
# Upgrade-safety design (T23, the 26.7.502 vanishing-exe postmortem):
#   - ghoztty.exe is built with a real per-build FILEVERSION
#     (-Dwindows-file-version=yy.m.d.NN, strictly increasing), and this
#     script mirrors the exe's ACTUAL PE version into the MSI File table
#     (wixl cannot read PE resources, so it emits an empty Version column —
#     Windows Installer then treats the packaged exe as UNVERSIONED, refuses
#     to overwrite the versioned installed exe, and RemoveExistingProducts
#     deletes it: net result "upgrade removed the exe").
#   - The MsiFileHash table is dropped: costing runs BEFORE the early
#     RemoveExistingProducts removes the old product's files, so any
#     unversioned file whose hash matched the installed copy was skipped by
#     InstallFiles and then deleted with the old product. Without hashes,
#     unversioned files fall back to the created/modified-date rule, which
#     always recopies MSI-installed (never user-edited) files.
#
# Requires: wixl, msiinfo (brew install msitools), python3 (GUID derivation).

         either comes back.

         (No double hyphen anywhere in this comment: XML forbids one inside a
         comment and wixl rejects the whole document over it.)

         ARPNOMODIFY used to be set, on the reasoning that a Modify button
         opening a wizard this product does not have is worse than no button.
         T1291 removed the premise: the maintenance path now asks Repair /
         Cancel in the app's own dialog. And on Windows 11 the Settings page
         offers a desktop app exactly two verbs, Modify and Uninstall; there is
         no Repair entry to turn on instead. With ARPNOMODIFY set, the page
         people actually go to when an app misbehaves offered nothing but
         Uninstall, and the repair was reachable only by finding the original
         download.

         So both surfaces now lead to the same repair:
           Settings, Modify          runs the ModifyPath Windows Installer
                                     writes (msiexec /I with the product code)
                                     at full UI, which is the maintenance path
                                     below: Repair / Cancel, then REINSTALL=ALL.
           Control Panel, Repair     runs msiexec with REINSTALL already set,
                                     i.e. the user has ALREADY chosen repair.
                                     NoteRepairRequested sees that, and the
                                     prompt stands down rather than asking the
                                     same question a second time. -->


    <!-- T1204: a per-user terminal NEVER asks for a reboot.

         On 2026-08-31 an upgrade over a running Ghoztty ended by demanding a
         restart of the PC. The file replacement had already completed; what
         Windows Installer had done was pick up the machine's unrelated
         pending-reboot state (Windows Update and Component Based Servicing
         each had a flag set) and present it as this install's requirement.
         Nothing this package installs can need one: every file lands under
         %LOCALAPPDATA%, there is no service, no driver, no shared in-use
         system component, and the only processes that can hold a file here
         are ours - which the Restart Manager closes and reopens.

         ReallySuppress is the strong form: it suppresses the reboot AND the
         prompt, in UI and silent installs alike, where REBOOT=Suppress still
         leaves the "restart now?" question at the end.

         Deliberately NOT set beside it: MSIRESTARTMANAGERCONTROL. Its only
         value is "Disable", and disabling the Restart Manager is the opposite
         of what this task is for - RM is what closes the running terminal,
         lets the files be replaced, and starts it back up (the app asks to be
         restarted in src/apprt/win32/restart_manager.zig). The read-back

    <!-- The beta deliberately omits a taskkill custom action. A type-50 EXE
         custom action running taskkill.exe pops a console window during
         install (alarming for a first-time install) and buys nothing on a
         fresh install. If a future upgrade needs to replace a running exe,
         the user is told to close Ghoztty first. Keep the install a pure
         file-copy + shortcut + registry write for maximum robustness. -->

    <!-- Installing ends with a running terminal, not a Start Menu entry the
         user has to go find (T1176). The pair is the shape the retired agent
         MSI proved on this same wixl 0.106 pipeline: a type-51 action puts
         the exe path in a property, then a type-50 action runs THAT property
         as the command. ghoztty.exe is GUI-subsystem, so unlike the taskkill
         action above this spawns no console window.

         asyncNoWait: the terminal is a long-lived app — msiexec must not wait
         for it to exit, and its exit code must not fail the install.
         Immediate execution after InstallFinalize runs it as the installing
         user, which is what a per-user install wants.

         When it does NOT fire, and why:
           NOT Installed          — uninstall and repair leave nothing new to
                                    show; Installed is empty on a fresh
                                    install and on a major upgrade's new
                                    package.
           NOT OLDERVERSIONFOUND  — an upgrade-in-place is the updater's
                                    path: the user already has Ghoztty open,
                                    and a surprise second window on top of it
                                    is not what "update" means.
           UILevel > 3            — a silent (/qn, UILevel 2) or basic-UI
                                    (/qb, 3) install is scripted, and nothing
                                    scripted wants a window it did not ask
                                    for. Only reduced (4) and full (5) UI —
                                    i.e. somebody double-clicked the MSI —
                                    end with a terminal.
           LAUNCHAPP = "1"        — the escape hatch: LAUNCHAPP=0 on the
                                    msiexec command line suppresses the
                                    launch without suppressing the UI. -->
    <!-- T1207: make room for the installer BEFORE it asks who is in its way.

         (Nothing in this comment may contain a double hyphen: XML forbids one
         inside a comment, and wixl's parser rejects the whole document with a
         line number that points at the comment rather than at anything real.
         Write flags without their leading dashes here.)

         Session persistence means `ghoztty-agent.exe` and one
         `pty-host` holder per live session keep the user's shells running
         after the terminal closes. Those processes have no windows, and the
         Restart Manager only offers a graceful close to processes that do -
         its only move on a windowless holder is to terminate it. So a
         double-clicked MSI over a running Ghoztty would end every restored
         session, which is precisely what the feature exists to prevent.

         This runs `ghoztty.exe` with the `install-prepare` flag out of the
         OLD install,
         immediately before InstallValidate - the action where Windows
         Installer asks the Restart Manager which processes hold the files it
         is about to write. It renames `ghoztty-agent.exe` aside (Windows
         refuses to delete a running image but will happily rename one; the
         open handles follow the file), so by the time that question is asked
         nothing holds the package's own agent path and there is nothing to
         shut down. The holders keep running the code they already mapped
         until they are next restarted, which is the situation the app-agent
         handshake already exists to handle.

         Deliberately NOT the app's own exe: ghoztty.exe is the one image the
         Restart Manager CAN close and reopen, and T1204 made it do so.

         Return="ignore" and immediate execution: this is politeness, not a
         prerequisite. If it cannot run, the install proceeds exactly as it did
         before this existed - an installer that refuses to run because an
         optional step broke would be strictly worse. Immediate (not deferred)
         because deferred actions run after InstallValidate, which is too late
         to change the answer, and because a per-user install under
         %LOCALAPPDATA% needs no elevation to rename its own file.

         Condition: only when there is an existing install in the way.
         Installed covers repair, uninstall and maintenance; OLDERVERSIONFOUND
         covers the major upgrade, which is the path the user takes. -->

         What it looked like: msiexec sees its own ProductCode already
         installed, enters MAINTENANCE mode, hands the whole question to the
         package's authored UI, finds there is none (this product deliberately
         has no wizard), changes no feature state and exits 0 without a word.
         The user, 2026-09-03: "it just silently quit ... there should be some
         message to ask what to do (reinstall, cancel)".

         The answer is the app, through the same type 51 / type 50 pair the two
         actions above use, rather than a WixUI dialog set: a second,
         differently styled installer UI for the rarest path is a worse
         experience than the one dark Ghoztty dialog every other prompt in this
         product uses. `ghoztty.exe install-maintenance` shows Repair / Cancel
         and answers with its exit code (src/apprt/win32/install_maintenance.zig).

         Three pieces, in the order they have to happen:

         1. SetRepairMode / SetRepairModeFlags pre-arm REINSTALL=ALL before
            CostFinalize, because CostFinalize is where feature states are
            decided and therefore too early to have asked the question yet.
            Nothing is written at that point, so pre-arming a repair the user
            then cancels costs nothing.
         2. MaintenancePrompt runs AFTER CostFinalize, which is the first
            moment INSTALLDIR resolves and therefore the first moment there is
            an exe path to run.
         3. Return="check": exit 0 lets the pre-armed repair proceed, and 1602
            (ERROR_INSTALL_USEREXIT) ends the transaction cleanly with no
            error dialog. That is the ONE non-zero code Windows Installer reads
            as "the user said no"; every other value surfaces as error 1721.

         Gated on UILevel > 3 for the reason LaunchApp is: the in app updater
         installs with /qb-! (UILevel 3), and a modal dialog inside an
         unattended update is a hang, not a courtesy. REMOVE, PATCH and
         UPGRADINGPRODUCTCODE exclude uninstall, patching and being removed by
         a newer package, so the only case left is the one the user hit.

         T1300: and REPAIRREQUESTED excludes a repair somebody has already
         asked for. Control Panel's Repair button and msiexec /f both arrive
         with REINSTALL set on the command line; asking "Repair or Cancel?"
         after the user pressed Repair is the question twice. The mark has to
         be taken BEFORE SetRepairMode, which sets REINSTALL itself and would
         otherwise make every maintenance run look requested. Skipping the
         arming rows too leaves the requester's own REINSTALLMODE alone. -->

    <!-- T1352: an upgrade over a RUNNING Ghoztty must not end in silence.

         (No double hyphen anywhere in this comment: XML forbids one inside a
         comment and wixl rejects the whole document over it. Flags are written
         without their leading dashes.)

         What the user hit on 2026-09-05: "i ran the latest ghoztty installer
         but it didn't reset this window at all. what's going on?" The install
         had succeeded. Windows cannot replace a running image, but MSI renames
         it aside and writes the new one, so the transaction completed with
         nothing to prompt about and every window carried on executing
         five day old code.

         Nothing that already existed could cover it. The Restart Manager
         (T1204) speaks only when it cannot proceed otherwise, and here it
         could. The stale build balloon and the About restart offer (T1205)
         live in the build that is NOT running, and a feature cannot announce
         itself retroactively out of a process started before it shipped.
         LaunchApp below is suppressed on the upgrade path, and would only have
         added a window to the old process anyway.

         The one process on the box guaranteed to hold today's code at that
         moment is the exe msiexec has just written, so the package runs it:
         `[INSTALLDIR]ghoztty.exe install-restart` (spelled with its leading
         dashes in the ExeCommand below). It finds the windows of the install it
         just replaced, offers Restart Now / Later in the app's own dark dialog,
         and on accept closes them with the same WM_QUERYENDSESSION /
         WM_ENDSESSION pair the Restart Manager sends, which the app answers by
         flushing its layout and exiting without marking any session closed
         (src/apprt/win32/install_restart.zig).

         asyncNoWait, exactly like LaunchApp: the files are on disk before this
         runs, and an installer that waits on a dialog, or that can be failed by
         one, is worse than the silence being fixed.

         When it does NOT fire, and why:
           NOT Installed          the maintenance and repair paths rewrite the
                                  same version the running process already is.
           OLDERVERSIONFOUND      the upgrade in place is the ONLY case where a
                                  running window is a build behind. This is the
                                  exact complement of LaunchApp's condition
                                  below: a double clicked MSI either opens a
                                  terminal (fresh install) or offers to restart
                                  the one already open (upgrade).
           UILevel > 3            the in app updater installs with /qb!
                                  (UILevel 3) and closes and relaunches the app
                                  itself; a modal inside an unattended update is
                                  a hang, not a courtesy.
           RESTARTAPP = "1"       the escape hatch, mirroring LAUNCHAPP: a
                                  scripted full UI install can suppress the

      <!-- T1367: every immediate action in this band carries an explicit
           Sequence number, and none of them anchors on another CUSTOM action.

           Why, from wixl's own sequencer (msitools tools/wixl): Before="X"
           records "X depends on me" and After="X" records "I depend on X",
           then the table is topologically sorted and an unnumbered action is
           given the running counter + 1 at the point it is emitted. Only
           actions with NO incoming dependency are used as entry points for
           that sort, and the custom ones are visited last - so an action
           reachable only through an After= is emitted after the final standard
           action and lands past InstallFinalize at 6600. That is the 6605
           T1364 saw for SetRepairModeFlags, and it was equally true of the
           Repair/Cancel question next door: asked once the install had already
           run, with a Cancel that had nothing left to cancel.

           Anchoring on a standard action with Before= happens to avoid it, but
           it says nothing about the order of two customs that anchor on the
           SAME standard action - that falls out of hash iteration order. The
           prompt has to be asked before PrepareInstallDir renames
           ghoztty-agent.exe aside, or a Cancel leaves the existing install
           without one. So the numbers are written down rather than derived.

           The band is CostFinalize (1000, where INSTALLDIR finally resolves)
           to InstallValidate (1400, where the Restart Manager picks the
           processes to shut down and the first bytes get committed to). The
           two arming rows sit just below CostFinalize because that is where
           feature states are decided. -->
