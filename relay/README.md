# ghoztty-relay

A secure rendezvous **relay** for the Ghoztty remote-machines feature. It lets a
local Ghoztty client open shells on a remote `ghoztty-agent` where **both ends
dial OUTBOUND** over `wss://:443`, so it works through NAT and corporate
firewalls without Tailscale.

The relay does three things and nothing more:

1. **Sign-in.** Clients (humans) authenticate with a Google OIDC ID token;
   agents (machines) authenticate with an enrolled device token.
2. **Directory.** Tracks which agents are online, per owner.
3. **Stream bridge.** Splices the two outbound WebSocket streams into one
   bidirectional, **opaque** byte pipe.

The relay is an ngrok-style reverse tunnel: the agent holds a long-lived
**control** WebSocket; when a client wants in, the relay sends an `open` command
over that control channel, the agent dials back a **data** WebSocket, and the
relay bridges the client's stream to the agent's data stream.

**It never inspects the payload.** SSH is tunneled end-to-end inside the stream;
the relay only ever sees ciphertext. TLS is terminated by **Caddy in front**, so
this Go service listens on plain HTTP (`127.0.0.1:8080` by default) and speaks
WebSocket.

See `../docs/design/remote-transport-relay.md` for the full design (§3
architecture, §5 security).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                              | Auth         | Purpose |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------|
| GET    | `/v1/agent/control`               | device token | Agent registers online; relay sends `{"type":"open","session":...}` commands; ping/pong heartbeat. An optional `X-Ghoztty-Hostname` request header upserts the device's `hostname` (older agents omit it). |
| GET    | `/v1/agent/data?session=<uuid>`   | device token | Agent dials back in response to `open`; matched to the session and bridged. |
| GET    | `/v1/agent/whoami`                | device token | Which account this device is bound to: `{email, device_id, name, hostname}`. Lets an agent's tray — and the macOS app, deciding whether the machine it runs on belongs to the account signing out — learn the identity behind an opaque token. |
| POST   | `/v1/agent/deenroll`              | device token | **Self** de-enroll: delete the device the token belongs to and sever every live connection. `204`; a token that no longer maps to a device gets `401`, which callers treat as "already revoked" so retries terminate. The relay side of the agent tray's *Sign out* AND of the macOS app's sign-out (see Revocation below). |
| GET    | `/v1/client/devices`              | OIDC         | List the caller's devices with online status and `hostname` (see below). |
| POST   | `/v1/client/devices`              | OIDC         | Enroll a device (`{"name":"..."}`); returns the raw device token **once**. |
| PATCH  | `/v1/client/devices/{id}`         | OIDC         | Rename an owned device (`{"name":"..."}`); changes the display name **only** (never `hostname`); returns the updated device view. |
| DELETE | `/v1/client/devices/{id}`         | OIDC         | Delete an owned device **and revoke its token**; any live agent connections are closed. Returns `204`. |
| GET    | `/v1/client/connect?device=<id>`  | OIDC         | Open a session to an owned, online device and bridge it. |
| POST   | `/v1/enroll/start`                | none         | Begin **self-enroll** (`{"name":"<machine name>", "flow":"web"\|"device"}`, flow defaults to `device`). Web → `{enroll_url, device_code_handle, interval, expires_in}` (503 when no Web OAuth client is configured — the agent's cue to fall back). Device → `{verification_url, user_code, device_code_handle, interval, expires_in}`. |
| POST   | `/v1/enroll/poll`                 | none (rate-limited) | Poll a pending enrollment (`{"device_code_handle":"..."}`) — same endpoint for both flows. Pending → `{"status":"pending"}`; approved → `{"status":"complete", device_id, device_token, relay_base}` **once**; denied/expired/rejected are terminal. |
| GET    | `/enroll/{nonce}`                 | none (browser) | Web-enroll entry link (single-use): 302 to Google's auth endpoint with the Web client and a fresh `state` bound to the pending enrollment. |
| GET    | `/enroll/callback?code&state`     | none (browser) | The Web client's registered redirect URI: exchanges the code server-side, verifies the identity (same gate as everything else), upserts the device, renders a tiny success/error page. |
| GET    | `/healthz`                        | none         | Liveness probe. |

### Device name vs hostname

Each device carries two independent labels:

- **`name`** — the user-facing display name. Set at enrollment (device-code
  enroll uses the machine name) and changed only by `PATCH`.
- **`hostname`** — the machine's OS-reported hostname (`omitempty`; absent on
  old devices whose agent hasn't reconnected yet). Seeded from the enrolled
  machine name at creation by device-code self-enrollment, then kept fresh by
  the agent: every `/v1/agent/control` connect may carry an
  `X-Ghoztty-Hostname` header, which upserts it. Rename never touches it.

The chooser UI uses this to show e.g. "MaximusHome" with "(windows-home)" as
subtext once the owner renames a device.

## Self-enrollment (browser flow, device-code fallback)

Agents on fresh machines enroll **themselves** — no pre-minted token to copy
around. The agent half is built in: `ghoztty-agent --enroll --relay=<base>`

1. `POST /v1/enroll/start` with `{"name":"<hostname>","flow":"web"}`. On a
   web-enabled relay the agent **opens the default browser** to the returned
   `enroll_url` (best-effort — `rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler` on
   Windows, `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` elsewhere) and prints:

   ```
   A browser window should have opened to add this machine to your account.
   If it did not, visit: https://<relay>/enroll/<nonce>
   ```

   The owner approves the Google sign-in in the browser — no code to type.
   Under the hood: `GET /enroll/<nonce>` (single-use) 302s to Google with the
   Web client and a fresh in-memory `state`; Google lands back on
   `GET /enroll/callback?code&state`, the relay exchanges the code
   server-side, verifies the ID token, upserts the device, and shows
   "✓ <machine> added to your account — you can close this tab".

   **Fallback** — when the relay answers 503 (no `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`) or
   `--no-browser`/`--headless-enroll` is passed, the agent restarts with the
   device-code flow and prints the classic prompt:

   ```
   To add this machine to your account, visit https://www.google.com/device
   and enter code: WXYZ-1234
   ```

2. Either way it polls `POST /v1/enroll/poll` with the returned
   `device_code_handle` (respecting `interval`; premature device-flow polls
   get `429 {"status":"slow_down"}`, which grows the agent's poll interval by
   5s per RFC 8628).
3. The owner signs in with Google (2FA and all) and approves.
4. The next poll returns `{"status":"complete","device_id":...,
   "device_token":...,"relay_base":...}` **exactly once**. The agent persists
   `RELAY_BASE` + `DEVICE_TOKEN` to its `relay.env`
   (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\relay.env` on Windows,
   `~/.config/ghoztty/relay.env` — or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` — elsewhere;
   `GHOSTTY_RELAY_ENV` overrides the full path) and prints
   `Enrolled as device <id>. Start the agent with: ghoztty-agent --relay=<base>`.

`--relay` mode then finds the token by itself: the `GHOSTTY_DEVICE_TOKEN` env
var wins, else the agent falls back to `relay.env` — so enroll → run needs no
env plumbing.

The agent's daemon modes (`--relay`, `--listen`) are single-instance per user
session: a second daemon logs `another instance is already running; exiting`
and exits with code **183** (named mutex `Local\GhozttyAgentDaemon` on
Windows; `flock` on `~/.config/ghoztty/agent.lock` elsewhere), so competing
supervisors can't stack up duplicate agents — `--stdio` and `--enroll` are
exempt and still work while a daemon runs.

### Hosted Windows installer — retired (T1175)

There is no standalone agent installer any more. Windows ships **one**
installer, the Ghoztty MSI, and `ghoztty-agent.exe` is a required sibling of
`ghoztty.exe` inside it — so a box with Ghoztty on it already has the agent,
and a box without it could previously end up with half a product. Enrollment
and serving moved to the machine chooser (`Ctrl+Shift+N` → sign in → **Share
this machine**), which is where the account UI lives on both platforms.

`/dl/install.ps1` **keeps answering**: the hosted copy (source:
`relay/deploy/install.ps1`; the live copy sits on the VM at
`/var/www/ghoztty-dl/` — re-upload after editing) is now a signpost that
prints where to get Ghoztty and how to share the machine. Old docs and old
chat logs still carry the one-liner, and a 404 teaches nobody anything:

```powershell
irm https://<relay>/dl/install.ps1 | iex
```

The enrollment flow described above is unchanged — it is what the agent runs
when the chooser's toggle turns sharing on, and an existing `relay.env` is
kept and reused, so a machine that was enrolled by the old installer stays
enrolled. Background: `docs/design/one-installer-agent-consolidation.md`.

### End-to-end tests against the real agent binary

`agent_enroll_e2e_test.go` drives the REAL Zig agent's `--enroll` against this
relay + the fake Google issuer, once per flow: device-code (start → printed
code → approval → poll) and web (printed link → redirect → callback), each
ending with `relay.env` written and the issued token authenticating
`/v1/agent/control`. They are gated so `go test ./...` stays hermetic:

```bash
(cd .. && zig build agent)
GHOZTTY_AGENT_BIN=$PWD/../zig-out/bin/ghoztty-agent go test -run TestAgentEnroll -v .
```

(The web test sets `GHOZTTY_ENROLL_NO_OPEN=1` so no real browser pops up on
the machine running the tests.)

Poll outcomes: `200 pending` (keep polling), `429 slow_down` (too fast),
`200 complete` (done, single-shot), `403 denied` (owner refused),
`410 expired` (code timed out), `403 rejected` (a real Google login that is
not on `ALLOWED_EMAILS`), `404` (unknown or already-consumed handle). All
4xx/410 outcomes except `429` are terminal — start over.

Design notes:

- **Google's `device_code` never leaves the relay.** The caller gets an
  opaque 256-bit `device_code_handle` instead; the real code is a bearer
  credential against Google's token endpoint, so keeping it server-side means
  the relay alone controls the poll rate Google sees and the owner's ID token
  never transits the (still-unauthenticated) agent box.
- **Enrollment is idempotent**: same verified owner + same requested name →
  the **same device id** with a **rotated credential** (the old token is
  revoked). Re-running the installer is therefore also the lost-token
  recovery path. A different name creates a distinct device.
- The ID token produced by the sign-in is verified **exactly** like
  interactive client auth (same verifier, same `ALLOWED_EMAILS`).
- Abuse bounds: pending enrollments are capped (32), expire on Google's
  `expires_in`, and per-handle polling is throttled to the advertised
  interval without contacting Google.
- **Web-flow state binding**: the browser entry link carries a single-use
  256-bit nonce; hitting it mints a fresh 256-bit `state` mapped in relay
  memory to the pending enrollment (no signing needed). The Web client
  secret, the authorization code exchange, and the ID token all stay
  server-side; the browser and the agent never see them. Web enrollments
  expire after 15 minutes.
- Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; the auth/device/token endpoints are read from
  Google's OIDC discovery document. Without OIDC configured the endpoints
  answer `503`. Google restricts the device-code grant to clients of type
  "TVs and Limited Input devices", so production sets
  `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (a second client of
  that type) for the enroll calls; when unset, enroll falls back to
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. The web flow additionally needs
  `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET` (a "Web application"
  client with `https://<relay>/enroll/callback` as an authorized redirect
  URI); when unset, web start answers `503` and agents fall back to the
  device-code flow.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable           | Default            | Purpose |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| `LISTEN_ADDR`      | `127.0.0.1:8080`   | Plain-HTTP listen address (TLS handled by Caddy). |
| `METRICS_ADDR`     | `127.0.0.1:9091`   | **Separate** Prometheus `/metrics` listener — deliberately never on the Caddy-proxied public mux, so metrics stay unreachable from the internet (Prometheus on the same VM scrapes localhost). Set to `off` to disable; a bind failure at startup is fatal (config error). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)*          | OAuth/OIDC client ID of the **Desktop** client the Mac app signs in with; ID tokens must carry this (or `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID`) as `aud`. Required for real client auth and for self-enrollment. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)*      | The Desktop client's secret. Used for Google's token endpoint during self-enrollment **only when** `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID` is unset (single-client fallback). Not confidential for this client type. |
| `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)*   | OAuth client ID of the **"TVs and Limited Input devices"** client used for device-code self-enrollment — Google only allows the device-code grant for that client type. When set, enroll start/poll present this client to Google, and ID tokens with this `aud` are accepted alongside `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`. When unset, enroll falls back to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. |
| `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)* | The TV/limited-input client's secret, sent with enroll token polls when `GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID` is set. Not confidential for this client type. |
| `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)*      | OAuth client ID of the **"Web application"** client used for browser enrollment. The client must have `https://<relay>/enroll/callback` registered as an authorized redirect URI. ID tokens with this `aud` are accepted alongside the other clients. When unset, web enroll answers `503` and agents fall back to device-code. |
| `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)*  | The Web client's secret, used server-side for the `/enroll/callback` code exchange. **Confidential** — keep it in the relay env only. |
| `RELAY_BASE_URL`   | *(unset)*          | Public https base URL returned to freshly enrolled agents (`relay_base`) and used to build web-enroll URLs (`enroll_url`, the OAuth `redirect_uri`). When unset it is derived from the request `Host` header, which is correct behind Caddy. |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS`   | *(empty)*          | Comma-separated authorization allowlist of verified Google emails. A valid login by anyone not listed is rejected — including at self-enrollment. |
| `STATE_DIR`        | `./state`          | Directory holding the SQLite database `ghoztty-relay.db` (WAL mode; persisted device hashes). A legacy `devices.json` here is imported once on first boot and then kept as a backup. |
| `QUOTA_MAX_DEVICES` | `10`              | Default per-account cap on enrolled devices, enforced at every device-creating path (manual POST + both enroll flows; credential rotation is exempt). `0` = unlimited. Per-account overrides live on `accounts.max_devices` (NULL = this default). Exceeded → `409` `{"error":"device quota exceeded","limit":N}`. |
| `QUOTA_MAX_SESSIONS` | `8`              | Default per-account cap on concurrent relay sessions (a session = one admitted client connect, setup through bridge end), enforced at `/v1/client/connect`. `0` = unlimited; override on `accounts.max_sessions`. Exceeded → `409` `{"error":"session quota exceeded","limit":N}`. |
| `RATELIMIT_SIGNIN_PER_MIN` | `10`       | Per-IP budget of **failed** client sign-ins per minute (successes are never charged). Exhausted → `429` + `Retry-After`. `0` disables. In-memory; resets on restart. |
| `RATELIMIT_ENROLL_PER_MIN` | `6`        | Per-IP budget of `/v1/enroll/start` requests per minute (unauthenticated, mints upstream Google traffic). Exhausted → `429` + `Retry-After`. `0` disables. |
| `RATELIMIT_ENROLL_POLL_PER_MIN` | `120` | Per-IP backstop on `/v1/enroll/poll` behind the per-handle interval throttle. Exhausted → `429` `{"status":"slow_down"}`. `0` disables. |
| `RATELIMIT_CONNECT_PER_MIN` | `60`      | Per-identity budget of `/v1/client/connect` attempts per minute. Exhausted → `429` + `Retry-After`. `0` disables. |
| `DEV_AUTH`         | `false`            | **Testing only.** Accept a static bearer as a stand-in for OIDC. Logs a loud warning at startup. |
| `DEV_CLIENT_TOKEN` | *(unset)*          | The static bearer accepted when `DEV_AUTH=true`. |
| `DEV_EMAIL`        | *(unset)*          | Identity that a successful dev-auth maps to (becomes the device owner). |

Setting up real Google OIDC (registering the OAuth client, flipping the VM from
`DEV_AUTH` to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`ALLOWED_EMAILS`, verification + rollback) is a
~10 minute runbook: see **`../docs/design/relay-oidc-setup.md`**. `DEV_AUTH=true`
and OIDC can coexist during transition — the static token and real ID tokens are
both accepted until `DEV_AUTH` is turned off.

### Security model (summary)

- **Clients:** the Google ID token is fully verified — signature against
  Google's JWKS (issuer `https://accounts.google.com`),
  `aud ∈ {GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID}`
  (explicit fail-closed allowlist; the latter entries only when configured),
  `exp`, `sub` present, and `email_verified == true`. The email must then be on
  `ALLOWED_EMAILS`. Presence of a token is never sufficient. The verified
  identity is `{email, sub}` (Google's stable subject ID). Every HTTP request
  the OIDC machinery makes (discovery, JWKS refresh) is bounded by a 15s client
  timeout. The whole path is exercised in `auth_oidc_test.go` against a fake
  local issuer (self-minted RS256 tokens): valid accepted; wrong aud/iss,
  expired, forged signature, unverified/missing email, and non-allowlisted
  logins all rejected.
- **Agents:** the presented device token is SHA-256'd and looked up by its
  digest against the stored hash (an indexed equality match on the digest, not
  the raw token). **Raw tokens are never stored or logged** — only their
  SHA-256 hash is persisted in the SQLite `devices` table.
- **Authorization:** a client may only list/connect/rename/delete devices whose
  `owner_email` matches its verified email. Unknown / unowned device IDs return
  `404` (not enumerable).
- **Revocation:** deleting a device removes its token hash (the token can never
  authenticate again) and immediately closes its live control connection and
  any bridged sessions — control *and* in-flight bridged data, so a client
  watching that machine's sessions loses the stream at the same instant
  (`TestDeenrollRevokesAndKicksLiveBridge`). Both revocation paths do this: the
  owner-scoped `DELETE /v1/client/devices/{id}` and the device's own
  `POST /v1/agent/deenroll`.
- **Sessions and devices are revoked separately, on purpose.** `POST
  /oauth/signout` revokes a USER SESSION only; every device the account owns
  stays enrolled, because an account may own headless hosts that no app is
  signed in on. `TestSignoutAloneLeavesMachineReachable` pins that down. The
  consequence is a client obligation, not a relay one: **signing out in an app
  running ON an enrolled machine must also de-enroll that machine**, or the
  machine stays listed, online, and bridgeable from every other client on the
  account. The macOS app does exactly that (`MachineEnrollment.swift`) — it is
  the fix for a real reported bug, not a hypothetical.
- **Fail-closed:** any auth failure → HTTP 401 (or WS close 1008) and **no
  bridge**.
- **Abuse bounds:** pending sessions are capped, session setup times out (~15s),
  control connections have a ping/pong heartbeat with timeout, and the
  unauthenticated enroll endpoints cap pending enrollments and throttle polls
  per handle.

## Build

```bash
go build ./...                 # local build
go test ./...                  # run the integration test (no Google/Caddy needed)
go vet ./...

# Cross-compile for the Linux VM:
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ghoztty-relay .
```

## Running behind Caddy

The relay listens on plain HTTP on loopback; Caddy terminates TLS (Let's Encrypt)
and reverse-proxies WebSocket upgrades through. A minimal `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
relay.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

(Caddy proxies WebSocket upgrades automatically; no extra directives needed.)

Run the service (e.g. under systemd) with production config:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<desktop-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID="<tv-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET="<tv-client-secret>" \
GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID="<web-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET="<web-client-secret>" \
ALLOWED_EMAILS="dzearing@gmail.com" \
STATE_DIR=/var/lib/ghoztty-relay \
LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080 \
./ghoztty-relay
```

A sample systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ghoztty-relay
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ghoztty-relay
Environment=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<desktop-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
Environment=GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_ID=<tv-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
Environment=GOOGLE_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET=<tv-client-secret>
Environment=GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=<web-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
Environment=GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET=<web-client-secret>
Environment=ALLOWED_EMAILS=dzearing@gmail.com
Environment=STATE_DIR=/var/lib/ghoztty-relay
Environment=LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080
Restart=on-failure
DynamicUser=yes
StateDirectory=ghoztty-relay

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Manual testing with DEV_AUTH

`DEV_AUTH` lets you exercise enrollment and the bridge with no Google or Caddy.

### 1. Start the relay in dev mode

```bash
DEV_AUTH=true \
DEV_CLIENT_TOKEN=dev-secret-token \
DEV_EMAIL=dev@example.com \
STATE_DIR=./state \
LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080 \
go run .
```

You'll see `WARN: DEV_AUTH enabled — not for production`.

### 2. Enroll a device (curl)

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/client/devices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"testbox"}'
# => {"id":"<device-uuid>","name":"testbox","token":"<raw-device-token>"}
```

The `token` is returned **once**; it is what an agent presents. List devices:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/client/devices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-token"
# => {"devices":[{"id":"...","name":"testbox","online":false,"created_at":"..."}]}
```

Device-code-enrolled devices (and any device whose agent has connected with an
`X-Ghoztty-Hostname` header) also carry `"hostname":"..."` in the view.

Rename and delete a device:

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/client/devices/<device-uuid> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"newname"}'
# => {"id":"...","name":"newname","online":false,"created_at":"..."}

curl -s -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/client/devices/<device-uuid> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-token"
# => 204 No Content; the device token is revoked and any live agent
#    connection is closed. A subsequent agent dial with that token gets 401.
```

### 3. Verify bytes flow through the bridge

The end-to-end flow (enroll → agent control WS → client connect WS → assert an
echo round-trips both ways through the bridge) is automated in
`bridge_integration_test.go`. It spins the server on a random port with
`DEV_AUTH`, registers a fake agent, connects a client, and asserts payloads
cross the bridge in both directions:

```bash
go test -run TestBridgeEndToEnd -v ./...
```

This proves the bridge end-to-end without Google or Caddy. Other tests cover
fail-closed auth (`TestUnauthorizedRejected`), refusing offline devices
(`TestConnectOfflineDevice`), and device CRUD in `devices_crud_test.go`:
rename (`TestRenameDevice`), delete (`TestDeleteDevice`), delete-revokes-token
(`TestDeleteRevokesCredential`), owner scoping (`TestCrudOwnerScoping`), and
the hostname field (`TestDeviceHostname`: enroll seeds it, list returns it,
rename preserves it, the control-connect header updates it).

| `devices_crud_test.go`       | Device rename/delete/revocation/owner-scoping tests. |
| `auth_oidc_test.go`          | OIDC client-auth tests against a fake local issuer (JWKS + self-minted RS256 tokens). |
| `enroll_test.go`             | Self-enroll tests against fake Google device-code/token endpoints (happy path, idempotent re-enroll, denied/expired, allowlist rejection, poll rate limit). |
| `agent_enroll_e2e_test.go`   | Gated e2e: the REAL Zig `ghoztty-agent --enroll` against this relay + the fake issuer (`GHOZTTY_AGENT_BIN`). |
| `deploy/install.ps1`         | Source of the hosted `/dl/install.ps1`, which since T1175 is a signpost that prints where to get Ghoztty rather than an installer (re-upload after editing). |
| `deploy/publish-agent.sh`    | Publishes the signpost and the relay's landing page to the VM. Since T550 it publishes no binary: `ghoztty-agent.exe` and `version.json` went with the agent self-updater that was their only reader. |
