# Watchdog for the go.md parity loop (tracker T139b).
#
# go.md says outright "Nothing supervises this loop": it perpetuates itself
# only through the /reset-context at the end of every turn, so a single turn
# that ends with a summary instead kills it silently. That has happened twice -
# six dead days (2026-07-21 -> 07-27) and again on 2026-07-28. This script is
# the supervisor: it watches the loop lock's heartbeat (scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1)
# and re-enters the loop when the heartbeat goes stale while tasks remain.
#
# Per tick:
#   0. If a stop has been requested (go-loop-exec.ps1 stop), do nothing at all.
#      This must come first: "tasks remain" is the re-entry trigger, so a
#      requested stop is exactly the state that would otherwise revive the loop.
#   1. If no open task file remains that this seat could work (status todo/
#      in-progress/blocked under docs\design\windows-parity-tasks\, minus
#      seat: mac tasks), do nothing - the loop is finished, not stuck.
#   2. Read the lock. Healthy (owner alive AND a recent sign of life AND a turn
#      that has completed recently) -> do nothing. Since T253 "sign of life" is
#      the newer of the heartbeat and the session transcript's mtime, so a turn
#      that is working beats it without anybody remembering to - see
#      scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1.
#
#      Since T1319 a sign of life is not enough on its own. A signal anything at
#      all can move - including this watchdog's own nudge, and including the
#      keystrokes that type a continuation into the composer and never send it -
#      cannot answer "is the loop WORKING". So the lock's `turn_age_minutes`
#      (which only a completed turn moves) is read too, and a held lock whose
#      turn has not completed inside -TurnStaleMinutes is re-entered anyway. A
#      pane holding UNSENT composer text trips the same wire at the lower
#      -TurnSuspectMinutes, because that is the exact shape that hid a 2h32m
#      stall behind a 31-minute transcript on 2026-09-04 - and since T1370 so
#      does an IDLE Claude TUI, which is what a turn truncated mid-sentence
#      leaves behind and what the composer arm cannot see.
#   3. Otherwise re-enter, choosing the cheapest action that fits:
#        a claude is alive IN THE PANE, pane not producing output
#                              -> send-keys the resume prompt + Enter
#                                 (the turn ended with a report; nudge it).
#                                 The default prompt is RESET-FIRST (T253) so
#                                 that a nudge landing on a session that was
#                                 alive after all costs a context reset, never
#                                 a second task in the same context.
#        pane alive but sitting at a shell prompt
#                              -> send-keys the resume shim + Enter
#        no lock at all, but the ledger's last pane is still open
#                              -> decide about THAT pane (T1478), which is the
#                                 parked-after-a-stop case: the session is idle
#                                 in a window nothing points at any more.
#        no lock / pane gone   -> +new-window running the resume shim
#      then hold off for -RearmMinutes so a wedged box is not spammed.
#
# None of those actions is evidence on its own: a focused window and a typed
# prompt both exit 0 over a loop that never comes back. -WaitForHeldSeconds
# gates the verdict on the LOCK reaching `held` instead (T1478).
#
# "A claude is alive IN THE PANE" is deliberately not "the pid I recorded is
# alive" (T241). A claude relaunched in the pane has a new pid and has not
# claimed the lock yet, so the recorded pid is a corpse while the pane is
# occupied - and on 2026-07-31 that made this script type the shim's PATH into
# a live Claude Code TUI, where it became a chat message. send-keys exit=0,
# nothing re-entered, no error anywhere. So the pane is asked directly
# (scripts\go-loop-pane-probe.ps1), and every typed re-entry is verified by
# reading the pane back afterwards.
#
# It also watches its own source and re-execs when this file or
# loop-session.ps1 changes, so an edit here takes effect without anyone
# remembering to restart a process that has been up for a week.
#
# Run detached so it survives the terminal that started it:
#   Start-Process powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -ArgumentList `
#     '-NoProfile','-ExecutionPolicy','Bypass','-File',
#     'D:\git\ghoztty\scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1'
#
# Or register it to autostart (no elevation needed):
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1 -Install
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1 -Uninstall
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1 -Status
#
# -Install registers TWO things, because one of them is not enough (T440). The
# HKCU Run entry starts it at sign-in and that is all it ever does: on
# 2026-08-03 this process died at 09:14 and stayed dead for thirteen hours,
# because nothing between one logon and the next re-runs a Run entry. So
# -Install also creates a per-user scheduled task that re-launches this script
# every -ReviveMinutes. Re-launching is safe to do forever: the single-instance
# mutex makes it a no-op while the watchdog is alive, so the task is a revival
# trigger rather than a second supervisor.
#
# Every action is appended to %TEMP%\ghoztty-go-loop-watchdog.log, and every
# TICK - including the ticks where the right answer is to do nothing - stamps a
# heartbeat into the state file so a reader can tell "supervising quietly" from
# "gone" without reading a log to find out whether the silence-watcher is
# silent.
