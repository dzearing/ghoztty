# Boot resilience for the go.md parity loop (tracker T829).
#
# Measured 2026-08-14: the box rebooted at 08:07 on 08-13 and the loop did not
# run again until 09:16 on 08-14. Twenty-five hours, zero tasks closed. The
# supervisor (scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1) was not merely asleep - its process
# did not exist, because BOTH of its revival paths are bound to an interactive
# session: the HKCU Run entry fires at sign-in, and the GhozttyGoLoopWatchdog
# scheduled task runs with LogonType=InteractiveToken, which Task Scheduler
# skips outright while nobody is signed in. T440's "the supervisor has its own
# supervision" does not cover the case where the supervisor's whole SESSION is
# gone.
#
# The uncomfortable fact this script is built around: WITHOUT ELEVATION,
# NOTHING CAN RUN ON THIS BOX WHILE NOBODY IS SIGNED IN. Running code in that
# window needs a SYSTEM service, a task registered with S4U or a stored
# password, or a Run-As-batch right - every one of them an admin operation, and
# a GUI loop could not use the result anyway, since Ghoztty and Claude Code need
# a desktop. So the chain that has to hold is:
#
#   1. the box creates an interactive session by itself      <- the broken link
#   2. a session appearing starts the watchdog IMMEDIATELY
#   3. the watchdog re-enters the loop
#
# Link 1 is the user's Windows sign-in setting, not code. Link 2 and link 3 are
# ours. This script therefore does three things and refuses to pretend it can do
# a fourth:
#
#   check   audit every link and say which one is broken, with the fix for it.
#   install harden links 2/3 as far as an ordinary user can: register the
#           watchdog task with an AT LOGON trigger (so revival is instant rather
#           than up to -ReviveMinutes late), clear the battery gates, and lift
#           the execution time limit. Idempotent.
#   record  MEASURE link 1 rather than infer it, once per boot, and shout when
#           it did not hold.
#
# Why measurement instead of reading the registry: the registry cannot answer
# it. This box has Winlogon\AutoLogonSID set to the user's own SID with
# AutoAdminLogon=0 and no ARSO consent value at all - a state that looks
# configured and is not, and that reads identically whether the last restart
# signed in by itself or sat on the lock screen for a day. The only honest
# answer comes from the box's own history:
#
#   boot   = Win32_OperatingSystem.LastBootUpTime
#   logon  = when explorer.exe started in this session
#
# winlogon.exe starts in session 1 at boot whether or not anybody signs in (it
# is what draws the lock screen), so it proves nothing; the SHELL starting is
# exactly "an interactive desktop now exists". On the outage above those two
# numbers are 08-13 08:07:07 and 08-14 09:16:26, which is the 25 hours, read
# straight off the running box.
#
# The known imprecision, stated rather than hidden: if explorer.exe is killed
# and restarts, the oldest one left is the restart, and the gap reads longer
# than it was. That errs toward reporting an outage that was not one, which is
# the safe direction here - a noisy report gets checked, a missed one is the
# disease this task is about.
#
# `record` appends one row per boot to a ledger (temp\go-loop-boots.jsonl,
# beside the lock) and is idempotent on the boot timestamp, so `claim` can call
# it every turn and the loud block is printed once per reboot rather than once
# per turn. go.md step 0 prints whatever it emits - that is the "loud signal
# instead of silence" this task asked for. It cannot be a signal DURING the
# outage, because during the outage there is no process to send one; it is the
# first thing anyone sees when the loop comes back, and it is a number rather
# than a memory.
