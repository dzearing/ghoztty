# Execution-window marking and duplicate resolution for the go.md loop (T139).
#
# The lock (scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1) answers "is another session already
# working the loop?". It cannot answer "which windows are even TRYING to?" -
# and that distinction matters, because the user routinely keeps a second
# Claude window open on this repo that only FILES tasks and never executes
# them. That window must never be treated as a rival, and must never be closed.
#
# So an execution window says so out loud: its Ghoztty window title is pinned
# to "<marker> ..." (default marker "[go-loop]") via `ghoztty +rename`, which
# `+list --json` reports back. Marked = executing. Unmarked = leave alone,
# always.
#
# `claim` is the one command go.md step 0 runs. It:
#   1. takes the lock,
#   2. on success marks this window and resolves any OTHER marked window as a
#      duplicate - it messages that window (so its session is told why), then
#      closes it, then CONTINUES; the user is never asked,
#   3. on BUSY stands down: messages the primary, unmarks, and closes itself.
#
# The arbiter is the lock, not a negotiation: whoever holds it is primary. That
# is symmetric (both sides compute the same answer) and cannot deadlock.
#
# `stop` / `resume` are the loop's off switch (user, 2026-08-23). `stop` does
# not interrupt anything: it writes a request that the NEXT `claim` refuses, so
# the turn in flight finishes its build, test, commit and push first. The
# watchdog and the health check read the same flag, or the loop simply comes
# back - see the Graceful stop block in loop-session.ps1.
#
# Actions: claim | mark | unmark | list | stop | resume
# Exit codes: 0 primary (carry on), 3 stood down (stop), 4 stopped by request
#             (the queue is drained; do not pick a task), 5 resume did not bring
#             the loop back, 2 error.
