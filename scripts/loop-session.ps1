# Shared helpers for identifying the go.md loop's Claude session and deciding
# how to resume it (tracker T138).
#
# Dot-source it:
#   . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'loop-session.ps1')
#
# Why this exists: `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` used to assume that killing
# ghoztty.exe kills the Claude session running inside it. Session persistence
# (T89) ended that - the agent owns the PTY and is deliberately never killed,
# so the session SURVIVES the upgrade and the relaunched app re-attaches it.
# Relaunching `claude --continue` on top of that produces a SECOND session on
# the same transcript, and both pick the same task (user-hit 2026-07-28).
#
# So the resume decision needs one fact: is the Claude that launched the
# upgrade still alive afterwards? These helpers answer that without guessing
# from pane trees (a local-agent pane reports pid 0 / empty working_directory
# in `+list --json`, see T98) and without confusing the loop's session with any
# OTHER Claude the user has open.
#
# NOTE: `go-loop-lock.ps1` dot-sources these too, as of T168 - it used to carry
# its own copy of the pid/stamp resolution. There is now exactly ONE
# implementation of "which claude owns this loop session, and is it still the
# same process?", so a fix to it cannot leave the lock and the upgrade making
# opposite calls about the same session. Anything added here loads into the
# LOCK's process as well: keep this file free of top-level side effects.

# Byte-exact native invocation (T279). Every consumer of this file hands
# generated text - a resume command with a quoted prompt, a window label - to
# `ghoztty.exe`, and PowerShell 5.1's own command-line builder corrupts that
# text silently. Loaded here so there is one copy for the upgrade, the
# watchdog and the lock alike; it defines functions only.

# T1290 gave the health LINE this clock and left the watchdog - the only thing

# 2026-09-04 the two disagreed in the worst direction: the observer was right
# (`DOWN ... turn_age=2h 32m`) and the actor was wrong (`healthy: ...
# age=31.51m (by=transcript)`), because the transcript's 31 minutes measured the
# keystrokes that typed `/rc` into the composer and never sent it.
#
# Two arms, because one is not enough:
#   - $StaleMinutes: no turn has completed in this long, whatever the pane is
#     doing. This is the backstop and it is deliberately generous - the caller
#     still has to prove the pane is not producing output before it acts.
#   - $SuspectMinutes + a non-empty composer: a pane holding text nobody
#     submitted, with no turn completed since, is a stalled turn and not a
#     working one. That is what makes the 2026-09-04 shape catchable in tens of
#     minutes rather than hours - a half-typed command is perfect camouflage
#     precisely because typing it refreshes the signal the watchdog trusted.
#   - $SuspectMinutes + an IDLE pane (T1370): a Claude Code TUI with nothing in
#     flight, with no turn completed since, is a stalled turn too - and it is
#     the commoner shape, because a truncated turn leaves the composer EMPTY.
#     On 2026-09-05 an API transport error ended turn 136 mid-sentence; the
#     composer arm looked, correctly found nothing, and the loop sat dead for
#     1h07m under the 180m backstop until a human noticed.

# WHY. Between 2026-09-09 09:46 and 2026-09-12 01:11 the loop did no work for
# 63.5 hours. The watchdog detected the stall correctly 716 times and nudged the
# pane 180 times, and every single nudge was answered inside a second by:
#
#   "You've hit your monthly spend limit - raise it at claude.ai/settings/usage
#    - your weekly limit resets Sep 12, 1am (America/Los_Angeles)"
#
# The loop came back at 01:11 because the quota reset at 01:00, not because the
# 180th nudge differed from the 179th. Nothing was wedged; the session was
# BLOCKED by something outside this box, and no supervisor here can type its way
# past that. The defect is that neither supervisor could SAY so: the watchdog
# logged `STALLED(by=turn)` 716 times with no reason attached, and the health
# line's note sent the reader to the pane - which nobody was standing in front
# of for three days.
#
# The answer was machine-readable the whole time. Claude Code writes each such
# reply into the session transcript with `isApiErrorMessage: true`, and a quota
# rejection carries `quotaLimits.status = "rejected"` and a `resetsAt` epoch. So
# the classifier reads the transcript the lock already names, and both

# sends verbatim (src/cli/send_keys.zig). Same reasoning as T200's
# -ResumePromptFile, one hop further down the pipeline.

# A BOM-less UTF-8 file holding exactly $Text - no trailing newline, because

# from that subsystem field. So this, the shape every reader here used:

# against a live pane: 0 characters through ghoztty.exe, 2856 through its
# ghoztty.com sibling, same pane, same second. That one line is why the
# upgrade's arrival gate had never once seen a prompt come back - it was reading
# nothing at all, for every prompt, since the gate was written. `2>&1` happens
# to force the wait (PowerShell has to build a pipeline for the merge), which is
# why the send-keys calls next door worked and the readers did not; but it also
# merges stderr into the data, which a `--json` reader cannot carry.
#
# T245 shipped `ghoztty.com` for exactly this: the same binary with the
# optional-header Subsystem WORD flipped to console, installed as a REQUIRED

# predates T245 has none, and there the caller's own `2>&1` is the only thing

# The ONE named case where a file is genuinely impossible (tracker T280), and

#
# `+send-keys` processes backslash escapes (\n, \t, \r, \e, \\) inside its
# POSITIONAL text arguments, so a Windows path is not safe to hand it raw:
# %TEMP% under a user called "tom" makes a shim path C:\Users\tom\... and the
# pane receives a TAB where \t was. Caught 2026-07-31 building the T241 negative
# control, whose own temp dir was ...\Temp\t241-negctl\ - the pane ran
# "C:\Users\David\AppData\Local\Temp241-negctl\fake-tui.cmd" and cmd said
# "cannot find the path". Doubling every backslash makes it arrive verbatim.
#
# T210's `--keys-file=` retired that problem at the transport instead: bytes go
# verbatim, no key notation and no escape processing, so nothing needs doubling.
# What it cannot retire is an exe that PREDATES the flag - and these scripts run

# NOT `Enter` on its own, and the reason is the whole of T428: a bare CR is only
# unambiguously a keypress when the receiving TUI can see where pasted text
# ended. `+send-keys` states that boundary by framing a TEXT run as a bracketed
# paste (ESC[200~ ... ESC[201~) and writing the KEY run bare after it - but it
# can only do that when ONE call carries both runs. A boundary the CLI cannot
# see is a boundary it cannot encode.
#
# The upgrade's reuse path deliberately types the prompt, VERIFIES it arrived,
# and only then submits (T210: a half-arrived prompt becomes a chat message, and
# a post-submit check races /reset-context clearing the pane). So the prompt
# itself cannot ride along in the submitting call - and decision D4 ruled that a
# lone `--keys-file=` run stays unframed, so the typing call cannot frame itself
# either. The submitting call has to bring its own text run.
#
# One space is the smallest text that makes the call a mixed text+key send,
# which is what earns the frame. Every way it can go wrong is harmless:
#
#   * frame honoured    -> a space is appended, the CR is a keypress, submitted.
#   * pane has 2004 off -> ` ` `\r` unframed: exactly today's bytes plus a space.
#   * paste ignored     -> the verified prompt is submitted unchanged.
#
# Trailing whitespace means nothing to the session receiving the prompt, so
# nothing here can turn a verified prompt into a FRAGMENT. That is the property
# the alternatives lack: holding back the prompt's last character (gate the
# head, frame the tail) submits a truncated prompt if the tail is dropped, and
# backspace-then-retype eats a real character if the retype is.

# code: on 2026-08-07 the loop sat all night at a full composer holding an
# unsubmitted `read go.md and go` while the delivery logs read OK, and the cure
# a human applied was one Enter.
#
# The only external evidence that a session took the prompt is MOTION. A Claude
# Code that is answering repaints - spinner, elapsed timer, streaming text -
# every second; an idle composer is static. That is the same property
# `--when-idle` is built on, so it is measured behaviour rather than a hope.
#
# Being ON SCREEN proves nothing either way, and mistaking it for proof is the
# actual defect: a composer holding an unsubmitted prompt looks exactly like a
# prompt that was just echoed. So a pane that will not move WHILE THE PROMPT IS
# STILL THERE is the suspect state, and it gets the submit pressed again,
# bounded, with every attempt reported to the caller.
#
# Two details are load-bearing:
#
#   * the baseline is taken AFTER a settle, because the paste painting is
#     itself motion and would read as the answer;
#   * the baseline is then FROZEN. Re-reading it after each press absorbs the
#     very repaint the press caused - the pane answers in milliseconds, the new
#     baseline already contains the answer, and the gate concludes "still not
#     moving" over a pane it just woke up. (Measured: it made every happy-path
#     run of test\win32\reset-context.ps1 fail.)
#
# I/O is injected so the decision is testable without a pane: -Read returns the
# pane tail, -Submit presses the submit again.
# MOTION IS A PROXY, AND A BACKGROUND SHELL FALSIFIES IT (user, 2026-09-06).
#
# The motion rule above assumes the only thing that can repaint the pane is a
# session answering the prompt. That is false whenever the loop left a
# background shell running - a build, a lane run, a watch. Such a pane repaints
# every second no matter what the composer holds, so the FIRST tick of the
# watch window reads as "the pane moved on its own" and the gate reports
# NUDGE SUBMITTED over a composer that was never submitted.
#
# Measured: 2026-09-06 08:21:37 logged "NUDGE SUBMITTED: the pane moved on its
# own" while `floor-lane.ps1` streamed output; at 08:26, 08:31 and 08:36 the
# watchdog still read `composer=pending` holding the same unsent text, and the
# turn had been dead for 76 minutes with the T1393 work uncommitted. A human
# pressed one Enter and it went. Exactly the failure T562 was written to catch,
# arriving through the one door T562's oracle does not watch.
#
# So when the caller can read the composer, the composer decides: empty is
# PROOF the prompt went, and text still sitting there is proof it did not,
# whatever the pixels are doing. Motion stays the rule only for callers with no
# composer reader, which is what `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` has.

# own, and a client that connects to a bound-but-not-yet-accepting pipe can
# block. The upgrade script's readiness loop only checked its deadline BETWEEN
# calls, so one blocking probe swallowed the whole 60s window without the loop
# ever iterating - and the app was then reported as dead while it was running
# fine (2026-07-30: the loop stalled until a human pinged it). Running the CLI
# as a child with a hard wait is what makes a deadline mean what it says.
#
# Returns a hashtable: Json (the payload, or '') and Why (why not, for the log).

# Graceful stop (user, 2026-08-23: "stop the task queue after the current one
# is complete and merged").
#
# The loop has no off switch. Closing the window does not stop it - the
# watchdog re-enters whenever the lock's heartbeat goes stale while open tasks
# remain, which is exactly what a closed window looks like. Killing the
# watchdog too stops it, but by amputation: it interrupts whatever turn is
# mid-build, leaves a claimed task in-progress and a dirty tree, and there is
# no record anywhere of why the loop went quiet.
#
# So the stop is a REQUEST, honoured at a turn boundary. A flag file says "no
# new turns"; the current turn runs to completion - build, test, commit, push -
# and the NEXT `claim` refuses. Three readers must agree or the loop comes
# back: `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim` (exit 4), `go-loop-watchdog.ps1` (skip the
# tick), and `go-loop-health.ps1` (report stopped, not down - otherwise the
# 2-hourly supervisor check reads a deliberate stop as a failure and revives
# it, which is the bug this is meant to prevent).
#
# The flag is a file and not a lock field on purpose: it must outlive the lock,
# survive the owner's death, and be greppable by a human who finds the loop
# quiet and wants to know why.
