# Deliver a staged Windows build to install locations 2 and 3, and PROVE it
# landed (tracker T198).
#
# The standing bar is that a user-facing fix reaches all three install
# locations: the installed release (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ghoztty`), the
# Desktop portable, and the network share. Only the FIRST has ever been
# scripted - `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` does it, and mirrors the binaries
# onward best-effort. Everything else about locations 2 and 3 (the dated
# backups, the share's loose `ghoztty-agent.exe`, and the portable ZIP that
# people actually download) was re-derived from prose in the session log every
# time, by a session that had never done it before.
#
# That costs correctness, not just time, and there are two measurements:
#
#   * T196 (2026-07-30) hand-built the portable zip. It exited 0 and was wrong
#     twice over - rooted at `Ghoztty-portable-x64\Ghoztty\...` instead of
#     `Ghoztty\...` (extracting it the documented way would have double-nested
#     the app directory) and carrying both `.pdb` files, doubling a network
#     download from 20.3 MB to 41.9 MB. Both were caught only because that
#     session happened to diff the new artifact against the one it replaced.
#   * 2026-08-10, found while writing this script: BOTH portable locations were
#     holding a DEBUG `ghoztty.exe` (`+edc526574`, PE subsystem 3 = console)
#     beside a RELEASE `ghoztty.com` (`+213a21f0d`). The morning refresh had
#     logged `extra install '...': ghoztty.exe, ghoztty.com, ...` an hour
#     earlier. The copy reported success; the file on disk was from a different
#     build. Nothing anywhere read the result back.
#
# So the point of this script is not the copy loop - a copy loop is easy. It is
# that every claim it makes is MEASURED afterwards:
#
#   * every delivered file is compared against its staging source (length and
#     modification time; SHA-256 with -DeepVerify),
#   * every delivered `ghoztty.exe`/`ghoztty.com` is asked `+version` and must
#     answer the commit this delivery is for,
#   * their PE subsystem must be GUI/console respectively, which is what
#     separates a release build from a Debug one without trusting a string,
#   * the portable zip is built from an explicit manifest (root entry
#     `Ghoztty\`, no `.pdb`, no `.bak*`) and its entry set is diffed against the
#     artifact it replaces; an unannounced shape change fails the run and the
#     zip is NOT published.
#
# Reachability is not failure: a location that is absent or unreachable (a
# sleeping NAS) is SKIPPED and named in the verdict. A location that is present
# and wrong is a failure - that is the whole distinction the old best-effort
# mirror could not make.
