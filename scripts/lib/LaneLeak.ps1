<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Find, explain and reap the test binaries a floor lane leaves running after
    it has already reported its verdict (T837).

.DESCRIPTION
    Measured 2026-08-14: the agent lane printed `LANE agent PASS in 191s` and
    stopped writing its log at 14:15:20, while `ghoztty-agent-test.exe` (pid
    4136) and `ghoztty-agent-core-test.exe` (pid 14704) -- both started 14:12:14
    by that lane -- were still alive at 14:40 with their CPU frozen at ~122s.
    Nothing looked for them: floor-lane.ps1 sweeps leaked WebView2 hosts and
    reports `leaked webview hosts swept: N`, and a leaked TEST BINARY was
    invisible to that filter (it is neither an msedgewebview2.exe nor a member
    of the lane's process tree once the tree is gone).

    So the first job here is COUNTING, not cleaning: a leak nobody measures is
    a leak that gets rediscovered by accident every few weeks. Every lane run
    now ends with a `leaked test binaries: N` number, on the same line as the
    webview count, whether or not anything leaked.

    Identity, and why it cannot just be "a test binary is running": the lane's
    process tree is already gone when we look, so parentage is not available.
    A leak is therefore a process that (a) carries one of the lane's test-binary
    names, (b) was NOT running when this lane started, and (c) was created at or
    after this lane started. (b) is what keeps a sweep from reaching into a
    binary somebody else was already running -- including a debugger session a
    human left attached -- and (c) is belt and braces on top of it.

    (a)-(c) alone cannot separate a SECOND run overlapping this one, and since
    T841 that overlap is SCHEDULED rather than forbidden: the idle soak daemon
    runs floor lanes in the box's idle time, by design, while a turn is running.
    On 2026-09-18 a soak round therefore reaped a turn's `ghostty-test.exe` --
    same name, started after the round's own lane -- and the turn's lane died at
    exit 255 with nothing printed, wearing the costume of the crash the soak
    exists to hunt. So there is a fourth rule, (d): the process's image must live
    under one of THIS run's build roots (T1648). Two builds on one box write
    their test binaries to different cache paths, which separates them exactly.

    Functions, split so the caller owns the policy and a test can drive each
    one without staging a real 30-minute lane:

      Get-LaneTestProcess    the test binaries alive right now
      Get-LeakedLaneProcess  ...minus the ones that were already there, plus the
                             created-after-the-lane-started rule, plus the
                             built-where-this-run-builds rule
      Get-LaneBuildRoot      where a lane's command builds its binaries, from
                             its --cache-dir / --prefix / --global-cache-dir
      Split-LaneLeakByRoot   candidates split into this run's and somebody
                             else's, by image path
      Test-PathUnderRoot     is this path inside that directory?
      Get-LeakedProcessStack a non-invasive `cdb -pv -p <pid>` stack for one of
                             them, which is what turns "it leaked again" into a
                             named wait
      Get-SelfSpawnedTestPids  the pids in a live tree that are a test binary
                             under a test binary -- the shape of a self-spawn,
                             and the CPU the stall detector must not count
      Test-BuildRunnerCommandLine  did the build runner launch this, or did the
                             code under test launch its own image?
      Invoke-LaneLeakSweep   report each leak loudly, capture its stack, kill it

    Explaining before killing is the point of the ordering: the sweep is
    cleanup, and cleanup that destroys the evidence guarantees the underlying
    bug is still unexplained the next time it happens.

function Get-LaneBuildRoot {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The directories a lane could have built a test binary into.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This is the answer to "whose binary is that?" (T1648). A zig build
        writes its test binaries under the caches and prefix it was given, so
        two builds on one box put their `ghostty-test.exe` at two different
        paths -- which is the only thing that separates them once the process
        tree is gone and the names are identical.

        A command carrying an explicit `--cache-dir` / `--prefix` is ISOLATED by
        construction (that is what the soak daemon's rounds do), so those paths
        are the whole answer and the repo is deliberately NOT added: a round
        that builds into its own scratch tree has no claim on a binary sitting
        in the repo's `.zig-cache`.

        A command with neither -- an ordinary floor lane -- builds into the local
        cache, which zig resolves against the cwd as `<repo>\.zig-cache`. That
        is where every lane test binary on this box actually lives.

        The GLOBAL cache is deliberately not a root, for both shapes. Zig builds
        packages and the build runner there, never a test binary, and it is the
        one directory the soak and a turn SHARE -- so admitting it would hand
        both runs a claim on the same path and reopen T1648 the day zig starts
        writing a test binary into it.

        [string[]] directories. Empty only when the caller supplied nothing.

function Split-LaneLeakByRoot {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Split leak candidates into the ones this run built and the ones it did
        not.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The baseline rule above ("a matching name that was not running when this
        lane started") cannot separate two CONCURRENT runs, and as of T841 that
        overlap is scheduled: the idle soak daemon runs lanes in the box's idle
        time, on purpose, while a turn is running. Its round then found the
        turn's `ghostty-test.exe` -- a name it shares, started after its own lane
        did -- took a stack of it and killed it, and the turn's lane died at exit
        255 with nothing printed. Measured twice on 2026-09-18.

        So identity is the build tree, not the name plus a clock. A candidate
        whose image does not live under one of this run's roots is somebody
        else's process, however new it is.
    .PARAMETER Roots
        This run's build roots (Get-LaneBuildRoot). EMPTY means no scoping is
        possible, and then nothing is dropped -- the sweep behaves as it did
        before, because a caller that cannot say where it built must not be
        silently disarmed.
    .PARAMETER Names
        The image names the rule applies to -- the SHARED test-binary names
        (`ghostty-test.exe` and friends), which is exactly the set where a
        second run can be mistaken for this one. A candidate carrying any other
        name is private to its caller by construction (floor-lane's
        -ExtraTestExeNames names a fixture nobody else runs, and a fixture lives
        wherever its harness put it), so it is never scoped out. Empty means
        scope everything.
    .OUTPUTS
        Mine / Foreign, each an array of the candidate objects.

        the test runner, not the product (T933). An empty/unreadable command

function Get-SelfSpawnedTestPids {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The pids in a lane's process tree that are a test binary launched BY a
        test binary -- plus everything under them.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The build runner launches each test binary directly, so a test binary
        whose ANCESTOR is also a test binary is never a legitimate step of the
        lane: it is the code under test spawning its own image (T933). That
        distinction is what keeps the stall detector honest. The detector calls
        any CPU in the tree "progress", so a self-spawned copy of the suite --
        which burns a core running every test again, and hosts a tree of
        WebView2 children while it does -- reads as a lane that is working. It
        is the opposite: the lane is waiting, and the noise is the bug.

        Descendants are included because the copy's own children (its shells,
        its WebView2 hosts) are its CPU too, and counting them would leave the
        detector fooled by the same run through a different process.
    .PARAMETER Tree
        Process objects carrying ProcessId, ParentProcessId and Name -- e.g.
        floor-lane.ps1's Get-ProcessTree output, or a CIM snapshot.

        $null is accepted and means the same thing as an empty tree (T982).
        `Mandatory` on its own REFUSES null, and a caller cannot always tell it
        is passing one: a PS 5.1 function returning an empty collection unrolls
        it to $null on the way out, so a sample that found no processes -- a
        tree whose root exited a millisecond ago, or a CIM query that came back
        empty on a loaded box -- arrives here as null and used to abort the
        whole floor run with a binding exception instead of failing one lane.
        A watchdog that dies on the sample it took is worse than no watchdog.
    .PARAMETER ExeNames
        The lane's test-binary image names.

        much CPU it has burned and how long it has outlived its lane, then
        either the stack that was captured or why there is none, then whether
        it was killed. A leak that is only ever a number in a summary line is
        one nobody can act on.
    .PARAMETER NoKill
        Report and explain, leave the processes alone (floor-lane's -NoSweep).
    .OUTPUTS
        Found / Swept / Stacks, so the caller can put the count on its own
        summary line.
