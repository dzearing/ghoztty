<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Read the crash dump Windows Error Reporting already wrote, instead of
    re-running the crash to make a new one (T460).

.DESCRIPTION
    T450 gave a crashed lane a stack by re-running the test binary under cdb.
    That only works when the crash REPRODUCES, and the crash it exists for
    lands on about half of runs -- so the first occurrence, the one that
    actually happened, yields nothing, and every intermittent crash is
    diagnosed by trying to provoke it again (D6, user: "we want it to be easy
    to diagnose crashes so that we can capture and fix them faster").

    Measured on this box, 2026-08-12: nothing needed inventing. WER's
    LocalDumps is already enabled machine-wide, and a Debug zig binary that
    dies of an access violation ALREADY leaves a minidump in
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps at the moment it dies -- unattended, on the first
    crash, at zero cost to a run that does not crash. Post-mortemed with
    `cdb -z` it yields exactly what the re-run yields:

        * every thread's stack, not just the faulting one
        * the original fault site (avthread!boom) sitting BELOW zig's
          handleSegfaultWindows frames, so the handler's own abort does not
          destroy it
        * source lines, from the pdb beside the built exe

    in about a second. So the always-on first-chance capture this task asks
    for already existed and nothing READ it. This library is the reader.

    Two measured facts worth keeping, because both are easy to assume wrong:

    1. LocalDumps is HKLM-only. An HKCU\...\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps
       key with a DumpFolder is ignored outright -- the dump still went to the
       HKLM default folder. So a per-exe DumpType=2 (full memory) entry needs
       elevation, which makes it an OPTIONAL upgrade rather than a
       precondition: the default mini dump already carries every thread's
       stack, which is what a stack question needs.
    2. The exception recorded in the dump is the ABORT (0x80000003 break),
       not the access violation, because zig's segfault handler runs first and
       then aborts. That is a presentation problem, not a loss: the AV frames
       are still on the same thread's stack under the handler. Write-CrashStack
       says so rather than letting a reader conclude the process died of a
       breakpoint.

        Asked of the FILE, not of the debugger, because the debugger cannot
        answer it. cdb opened a dump taken of a healthy, running process (what

        zig binary aborts on. Reading that as a crash would manufacture a stack
        for a bug that never happened, which is the one failure this whole path
        must not have.

        The full path of the EXE this dump was taken of, as recorded in it.
    .DESCRIPTION
        WER names its files `<exe>.<pid>.dmp`, and both zig test lanes build a
        `ghostty-test.exe`, so the file name cannot say which program died
        (T855). The dump itself can: MINIDUMP_MODULE_LIST (stream type 4) lists
        every loaded module, and the FIRST entry is the executable, recorded with
        the .zig-cache\o\<hash>\ directory it was built into.

        That directory is what tells a none-lane crash from a win32-lane one --
        and it is also the right place to look for the pdb, which is how a stack
        gets source lines that belong to the build that actually crashed rather
        than to whatever was linked last.

        Layout: MINIDUMP_HEADER {sig,ver,count,dirRva}; directory entries
        {type,size,rva} of 12 bytes; the module list is {count:u32, modules...}

        Turn a dump Windows already wrote into the same result a live catch

        Directory holding the pdb for the crashed binary (in this repo, the

        module+offset rather than source lines.

        A copy of the dump is kept in -OutDir under the same name shape the
        live catcher uses, so it survives WER's own DumpCount rotation and is
        bounded by the same retention.
