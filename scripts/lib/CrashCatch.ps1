.SYNOPSIS
    Catch a crashing Windows process under `cdb` and keep the evidence: a full
    minidump on disk plus symbolised stacks for EVERY thread (T450).

.DESCRIPTION
    Zig's segfault handler dies in a recursive panic on this box, so a crashing
    test binary prints two lines and no stack:

        Segmentation fault at address 0xffffffffffffffff
        aborting due to recursive panic

    The handler faults while walking the stack, which means the one artefact
    that would name the culprit is exactly the artefact the crash destroys.
    Every investigation into the T443 corruption therefore started blind, and
    worse: the handler only ever sees the VICTIM's thread. The thread that did
    the damage is not in the picture at all.

    A debugger sidesteps both problems. It takes the exception on FIRST chance,
    before any in-process handler runs, so the recursive panic never happens,
    and it can walk every thread in the process rather than the one that
    tripped over the damage.

    `cdb.exe` IS available on this box, contrary to what T443/T449/T450 all
    recorded: the Microsoft Store WinDbg package ships a console `cdbX64.exe`
    under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WinDbg_8wekyb3d8bbwe.
    Nothing needs installing and nothing needs elevation. See Get-CdbPath.

.NOTES
    Dot-source it:  . "$PSScriptRoot\lib\CrashCatch.ps1"
    ASCII only, PowerShell 5.1 compatible.

    Two cdb details that cost an experiment each and are easy to re-break:

    1. Paths inside a QUOTED cdb command string are parsed by cdb, which treats
       backslash as an escape -- `.dump /ma D:\a\b.dmp` arrives as `D:ab.dmp`.
       Use FORWARD slashes inside those strings (Windows accepts them) rather
       than doubling backslashes.
    2. cdb's initial commands (-c / -cf) run at the FIRST break, which is the
       loader breakpoint. That is where the exception filters get registered
       (`sxe -c "<commands>" av`), and only then does `g` start the program.
       Passing -g skips the loader break, so the first break becomes the crash
       itself and the filters are registered too late to ever fire.
#>

# The NTSTATUS table lives there, and T478 needs it to say what a nonzero exit
# code MEANS rather than printing a bare number. Dot-sourcing twice is harmless,
# and CrashDiag.ps1 dot-sources nothing itself, so there is no cycle to worry
# about.

# --------------------------------------------------------- locating binaries

# The test binaries each zig lane produces. `none` and `win32` build the same
# name into different cache directories, so these are matched newest-first by
# write time rather than by path.

# What a lane's test binary is MADE OF, so a candidate can be checked rather
# than assumed (T855).
#
# Newest-mtime alone is not a lane: `none` and `win32` both build
# `ghostty-test.exe`, so whichever lane linked last wins the name for both, and
# `-Lane none` silently ran the win32 binary during the T504 triage. Nothing in
# the output said so, and every number that came out of it was about the other
# program.
#
# Zig embeds each test's fully-qualified name in the binary, and `-Dtest-filter`
# leaves the excluded ones OUT, so the test names answer both questions this
# resolution has to ask:
#
#   Core    - names every full build of that lane must carry. All missing-but-one
#             is a filtered (`-Dtest-filter`) build, which must never stand in
#             for the lane it was cut from.
#   Only    - names ONLY this lane compiles. The win32 apprt is not in the none
#             lane's module graph at all, so its GUI tests are the discriminator.
#             (Pure-logic win32 files like layout_blobs ARE in both lanes -- the
#             markers here are deliberately ones that touch HWNDs.)
#   NotThis - the other lane's `Only` markers, whose PRESENCE proves the
#             candidate is that other lane's binary.
#
# The agent lane's exe has a unique name and cannot be confused with a lane, so
# it carries Core alone -- there is still a filtered build to catch. It is also
# the lane's ONLY binary since T434; a name that is not in this table resolves
# with "no lane signature -- not checked", which is what -ExtraExeNames relies
# on for a fixture run.

# binary's exact size and mtime. A stamp is a fact where the markers are an
# inference, so it is preferred; the markers still run beside it, both to catch
# a stamp that contradicts the binary and to report table drift without letting
# a renamed test stop the tooling. An older build in the cache has no stamp and

function Resolve-LaneTestBinary {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The lane's own test binary, CHECKED -- with the rejects and the reasons.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Candidates are still gathered newest-first (a lane that relinked is the
        one being asked about), but "newest" no longer decides: each candidate is
        read for the lane's test-name markers and the first one that IS this
        lane's full build wins. When none is, the answer is a loud failure
        naming what was found instead -- never the other lane's program.
    .PARAMETER MaxCandidates
        How deep to look per exe name. Reading a candidate costs about half a
        second; the cache holds every build of the day, and a lane that is not in
        the newest handful has not been built recently enough to be the subject.
    .PARAMETER ExtraExeNames
        Additional exe names to resolve alongside the lane's own. Every real lane
        builds ONE binary since T434, so the multi-binary paths downstream (a log
        per binary, per-exe attribution in the soak summary) would have no way to
        be exercised -- this is how a fixture declares its second name without
        the table claiming the build produces it.
    .OUTPUTS
        One object per exe name the lane builds: Name, Path, CacheDir, Ok,
        Reason, Verdict, Rejected (path+reason pairs), Candidates.

    .DESCRIPTION
        `zig build` leaves them under .zig-cache\o\<hash>\. Running one directly
        is far cheaper than re-running the lane (no build, no build runner) and
        is how T443's repro loop already works.

        A path comes back only when Resolve-LaneTestBinary has confirmed the
        lane (T855). An unconfirmed candidate is dropped rather than returned,
        so a caller that only checks `.Count` still cannot end up running the
        other lane's program; callers that want to SAY why should ask
        Resolve-LaneTestBinary directly and print with Write-LaneResolution.
    .PARAMETER AllowUnverified

        that has no lane claim to falsify -- and it still says so.

# `bpe` deserves its own note, because leaving it out is what made this catcher
# lie for a month (T478). A Zig panic ends in `int3`, and cdb OWNS int3: with no
# filter registered for it the debugger consumes the break as its own, the
# script's `g` has already returned, and the next command in the script (`q`)
# quits -- so the transcript holds no crash block and the run reads as clean.
# The T477 test binary died on 10 runs out of 10 and `crash-catch` reported
# "ran clean in 17s" for every one of them.
#
# The cost of arming it is that a program which raises a breakpoint on purpose
# and handles it would now be stopped. Nothing this repo runs does that, and a
# first-chance int3 in a process nobody is debugging is fatal by construction
# (Zig panic, `@breakpoint()`, a CRT assert, `__debugbreak`) -- being told about
# it is the whole point. Planted breakpoints are unaffected: cdb matches an int3
# against its own `bp`/`ba` list first, so DataBreak.ps1's `bp0` command files
# still run (measured, and pinned by test\win32\crash-stacks.ps1).

        The last thing Zig's test runner said before it died, cleaned up.
    .DESCRIPTION
        That line names the test that was running -- `2066/3833
        terminal.search.screen.test.simple search with history...` -- which is
        the landmark every T443 datum is keyed to. It arrives on stderr wrapped
        in progress escape sequences and carriage returns, so it needs undoing
        before it is readable.

function Invoke-CrashCatch {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Run a program under cdb; on a fatal exception write a full dump and
        every thread's stack, then return what was found.
    .PARAMETER Attempts
        Run the program up to this many times, stopping at the first crash. The
        T443 crash is intermittent (roughly half of runs), so a single attempt
        is not evidence of anything when it comes back clean.
    .OUTPUTS
        One object per call: Crashed, Attempt, Attempts, ExceptionCode,
        ExceptionName, FaultSite, ThreadCount, SourceLines, LastTest, DumpPath,
        LogPath, ErrLogPath, FaultingStack, AllStacks, ExitCode, Seconds.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Print the compact `-- crash stack --` block for a caught crash.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The faulting thread's frames go to the console; the ALL-thread stacks
        and the dump stay on disk, because the whole point of this task is that
        the thread that did the damage is usually not the one that faulted, and
        that reading takes a human or a follow-up query rather than 40 lines of
        console spam.
