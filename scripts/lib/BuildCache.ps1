.SYNOPSIS
    Size/free-space accounting for the zig build caches, and the whole-cache
    clear that keeps the repo drive from filling up (T1054).

.DESCRIPTION
    Zig never evicts: every distinct build hash keeps its full output under
    `.zig-cache\o\<hash>\`, and a debug `ghoztty.exe` is 48 MB with a 100 MB
    `.pdb` beside it. Four floor lanes several times a day plus acceptance and
    staging builds is ~40 GB a day, and on 2026-08-21 that reached exactly 0
    bytes free on D: -- 31,359 entries, 1,235 GB. What that looks like from
    inside a turn is worse than an out-of-disk message: every lane dies in five
    seconds with a bare `error: Unexpected` from zig, which reads as red code.

    Two rules come out of that morning, and they are why this file is shaped
    the way it is.

    **Clear WHOLE, never by age.** The first remedy tried was an age prune of
    `.zig-cache\o` (28,369 entries, 1,082 GB) and it broke the very next lane:
    Zig's manifests under `.zig-cache\h\` still recorded those outputs as hits,
    so the build runner failed with `failed to spawn build runner
    .zig-cache\o\<hash>\build.exe: FileNotFound`. The user's call on seeing it
    was "clear it completely and start fresh if this is just build artifacts",
    and that is the policy: a cache that is entirely regenerable does not need
    a subtle eviction policy, and the subtle policy is what produced the
    dangling manifests. `Clear-BuildCache` therefore removes the cache
    directory whole -- `o\`, `h\`, `c\`, `tmp\`, all of it.

    **Ask the cheap question first.** The trigger is FREE SPACE, which is an
    O(1) call to the drive; a claim on a healthy box must not walk 30,000
    directories to learn that nothing is wrong. `Get-BuildCacheState` therefore
    never sums file sizes. Its second, still-cheap signal is the ENTRY COUNT of
    `.zig-cache\o` -- one non-recursive directory enumeration, no stat per file
    -- used as a size proxy at the measured ~40 MB per entry. That proxy is
    approximate on purpose: it only has to be right about "this cache is now
    enormous", and it is bounded by the free-space trigger on any drive where
    being wrong would matter.

        T1431. Zig's C/C++ compile steps (glslang, oniguruma, translate-c,
        helpgen) write their intermediates into %TEMP%, which on this box lives
        on C: while everything else the build touches lives on D:. On
        2026-09-07 C: had 0.1 GB free and every `zig build` died with a bare
        `error: Unexpected` naming no file, no line and no disk -- the T1054
        failure again, but on a drive nothing was measuring, so the cache
        sweeper reported 1 TB free while the build could not write a byte.
        Pointing TMP/TEMP at the repo drive made the same build succeed with no
        other change.

        `GHOZTTY_BUILD_TEMP` overrides, which is what lets the acceptance
        harness drive a fixture directory instead of the real one.

        Deliberately environment-based rather than a flag on the zig command
        line: the compile steps that fill %TEMP% are several layers below the
        caller (zig -> clang -> a linker temp), and an environment a child
        inherits is the only place all of them can be reached from.

        Scoped rather than permanent because these callers keep using %TEMP% for
        their OWN files - a build log, a version probe - and a helper that moved
        those too would relocate paths its caller had already printed. A caller
        that must not move its own %TEMP% at all (`floor-lane.ps1`, whose lane
        logs an acceptance harness finds by path) asks `Resolve-BuildTempDir`
        instead and sets the two variables on the build shell it spawns.
