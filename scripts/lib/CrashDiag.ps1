.SYNOPSIS
    Decode the exit codes a crashed Windows child reports through `zig build`,
    and correlate them with the Windows Application crash log (T444).

.DESCRIPTION
    `zig build` on Windows can end a step with

        error: the following command exited with error code 5:

    and print no diagnostic at all. Two investigations read that as a compile
    error that was somehow not printed. It is not: the step's child process
    CRASHED, and 5 is what is left of the crash code.

    `std.process.Child` truncates the Windows exit code to a byte
    (`lib/std/process/Child.zig:462`, `@as(u8, @truncate(exit_code))`), so an
    NTSTATUS comes out the other side as its LOW BYTE:

        0xC0000005 ACCESS_VIOLATION   -> 5
        0x80000003 BREAKPOINT         -> 3      (a Zig panic / segfault handler)
        0xC00000FD STACK_OVERFLOW     -> 253
        0xC0000409 STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN -> 9

    That mapping is lossy, so a low byte on its own is a SUSPICION, never a
    verdict -- a program really can call exit(5). The Windows Application log is
    what turns it into evidence: a crashed process leaves an `Application Error`
    (id 1000) record naming the exe, the exception code, the faulting module and
    the fault offset. This library reads both and prints them together.

        The first line of a lane transcript that says a TEST BINARY died --

    .DESCRIPTION
        Two shapes count here, and neither of them is handler text:

          - a `CRASH <hh:mm:ss> <exe> pid=... <code> <name> in <mod>+<off>` line
            out of Write-CrashDiagnostic's own block. That line is already
            corroborated by the Windows `Application Error` record, so it is
            evidence rather than a guess. It IS name-filtered, because the block
            is not: Write-CrashDiagnostic reports every crash in the window,
            ours or somebody else's.
          - zig naming a command that `exited with [error] code N` whose low
            byte decodes to a fatal NTSTATUS (3 = 0x80000003 breakpoint, i.e. a
            panic/segfault-handler abort; 5 = 0xC0000005 access violation).

        T877 is why this is a function instead of a pattern in one caller: the
        soak's classifier knew neither shape, so a round whose own log carried a
        decoded CRASH line was counted as a plain red test, and the crash rate
        the T443 hunt records was biased low by the instrument built to measure
        it. A run's classification must agree with the diagnostic printed in the
        same log.

        The matching line, trimmed; the empty string when nothing in $Lines says
        a test binary died.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The same two pieces of evidence the soak counts a crash round by (T877),
        so the lane word and the soak's tally cannot disagree about one run:

          - an `Application Error` record naming a test binary since the lane
            started (the condition Invoke-LaneCrashCatch already gates on), or
          - a line in the lane log that Get-CrashOccurrenceLine calls an
            occurrence (zig's truncated `exited with code N` of a fatal
            NTSTATUS).

        A compiler crash is never a test-binary crash: T451's verdict owns that
        case, and its retry policy keys on the lane still reading FAIL. A test
        crash in the same window vetoes the compiler verdict upstream, so the
        two cannot both hold.
