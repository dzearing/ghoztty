.SYNOPSIS
    Recognize a torn zig-cache entry in a red lane's log and delete exactly
    that entry, so the lane can be retried once instead of reported as a code
    failure (T494).

.DESCRIPTION
    A half-written cache file (a crash or power blip mid-write) makes the
    compiler choke on garbage: the observed case was a 2036-byte options.zig of
    ZEROS under .zig-cache\c\<hash>\, failing the `none` lane with
    "error: expected type expression, found 'invalid token'" as if the change
    under test were red. The signature is recognizable -- a compile `error:`
    whose FILE LOCATION sits inside a zig cache directory -- because the code
    this repo compiles never lives there; only generated/cached artifacts do.

    A torn entry does not always get NAMED by an `error:` line, which is what
    T973 cost a turn: after the 2026-08-18 reboot a truncated build_options
    `options.zig` under `.zig-cache\c\<hash>\` failed the win32 and agent lanes
    with `error: root source file struct 'options' has no member named
    'app_version'` pointing at intact `src\build\Config.zig`, and named the
    cache only sideways -- on the compiler's `note: struct declared here` line.
    Two more shapes are therefore recognized, both narrower than the
    unconditional error-line rule, because a note only LOCATES a declaration;
    it does not assert that the content there is wrong:

      * a DECLARATION note (`note: struct declared here` and friends) whose
        location is inside a cache entry -- the compiler saying the thing the
        source expected lives in generated content that does not have it;
      * ANY cache-resolving line, error or note, whose file fails an on-disk
        integrity check (missing, empty, zero-filled, or not newline
        terminated -- the shapes a half-written file actually takes).

    Notes that merely pass THROUGH intact generated code (`note: called at
    comptime here`) still heal nothing, so a genuine compile error keeps its
    diagnosis. The cost ceiling is unchanged either way: a wrong heal deletes a
    regenerable entry and the lane fails again on the retry, which the caller
    reports as final.

    Detection and healing are split so the caller (floor-lane.ps1) can decide
    the retry policy and a test can drive the functions against planted logs:

      Get-TornCacheEntry        log -> the cache entry dir(s) blamed, or none
      Get-CacheCorruptionWarning log -> the non-fatal "Invalid timestamp in
                                cache entry ... error.Overflow" lines, which
                                corroborate a torn cache but name no entry
      Test-CacheFileIntact      one cached file -> does it look whole on disk
      Get-TornPackage           global cache -> fetched packages that look
                                half-extracted, asked WITHOUT a failing build
      Invoke-CacheHeal          delete the named entries, loudly

    A THIRD shape is a torn FETCHED PACKAGE rather than a torn generated file
    (T1436). On 2026-09-07 every build and all four floor lanes died at once on

      error: failed to check cache: 'D:\zig-global-cache\p\N-V-__8A...\fonts\ttf\JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf' file_hash FileNotFound

    -- the package directory held two text files and a few macOS AppleDouble
    sidecars, and the `fonts/` tree the message names was simply gone. Nothing
    here saw it: the line carries no `:line:col:`, so the compile-error rule
    above never matched it, and the unit of repair is a directory under `p\`
    whose name is a package hash rather than a hex digest, which
    Resolve-CachePath refused. Both are handled now -- the `failed to check
    cache:` line is parsed on its own terms, and `p\<package-hash>` is a
    recognized entry shape, deleted whole so the next build re-fetches it.

    Safety over eagerness: an entry is only ever named when the path resolves
    to <cache-root>\<single-letter-bucket>\<hash>, and Invoke-CacheHeal
    re-verifies that shape before deleting. A mis-parsed compiler line can
    therefore never aim the delete at source, and a genuine compile error in
    generated-but-correct cache content simply fails again on the retry, which
    the caller reports as final.

    And the delete has to be able to WIN, which it could not until T1499: the
    real torn package on this box held AppleDouble sidecars including a file
    named `._.`, which defeats `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` outright -- the
    name resolves to the directory itself, the delete reports it missing, and
    the non-empty parent is then refused. The heal printed FAILED, returned 0,
    and every lane re-ran into the same failure until a human deleted it by
    hand with a `\\?\` path. `Remove-TreeHard` (scripts\lib\HardDelete.ps1) is
    that hand-delete as code, and Invoke-CacheHeal names which attempt it took.

# already removed the `._fonts` sidecar, which was the only thing
# Get-TornPackage could see, and `build-cache.ps1 check` then called the still
# broken cache clean. The marker dies with the entry the moment a later delete
# succeeds, so it cannot go stale.

        Is this directory name a zig PACKAGE hash (the `p\` bucket's entries)?
    .DESCRIPTION
        Two shapes exist, both copied verbatim into build.zig.zon by `zig fetch`:

          libxev-0.0.0-86vtc4IcEwCqEYxEYoN_3KXmc6A9VLcm22aVImfvecYs
          N-V-__8AAIC5lwAVPJJzxnCAahSvZTIlG-HhtOvnM1uh-66x     (anonymous)

        Both END in a base64url digest of at least 40 characters, and that is
        the discriminator: the last 40 characters of the name must be pure
        base64url ([A-Za-z0-9_-]) with no dot in them, the whole name must
        look like a package hash ([A-Za-z0-9_.-]), and it must contain a
        hyphen, which every one of these does. Splitting on the last hyphen
        instead does NOT work and was the first attempt -- base64url uses `-`
        as a digit, so the anonymous hash above ends `...-66x`.

        Deliberately strict, because the whole point of a shape test is that
        a mis-parsed path cannot aim a recursive delete at something that is
        not regenerable. It rejects the set-aside copies this box makes by
        hand (`<hash>.torn-20260907` puts a dot inside the final 40), scratch
        directories like `tmp`, short names, and anything carrying a path
        separator.

function Get-TornPackage {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Fetched packages that look half-extracted, asked of the cache itself.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The other half of T1436: a torn package is SILENT until a build needs
        the file that went missing, so `go-loop-exec claim` reported
        "build cache ok: 1025.8 GB free, 1474 entries" minutes before every
        lane on the box went red. That check counts entries and free space; it
        never asks whether any of them is whole.

        Whole is not cheaply decidable -- the honest answer is re-hashing the
        tree, which is minutes for 1500 packages -- so this asks the two
        questions that are O(one non-recursive listing) per package and that
        the observed tear answers YES to:

          * EMPTY: the package directory exists and holds nothing. An
            extraction that produced no files at all.
          * ORPHAN SIDECAR: a macOS AppleDouble `._<name>` with no companion
            `<name>` beside it. That is exactly what was left on 2026-09-07 --
            `._fonts` survived and the whole `fonts/` tree it describes did
            not -- and a sidecar without its file cannot be a correct
            extraction of any archive. `._.` is exempt: it describes the
            archive's own root, names no sibling, and ships intact in three
            of this box's packages.

        It is a smoke alarm, not a proof: a package torn in a way that leaves
        neither tell reads as fine here and is still caught by
        Get-TornCacheEntry the moment a build trips over it. Missing one costs
        nothing that was not already covered; a false positive would cost a
        re-fetch, which is why both rules describe states that cannot occur in
        a correct extraction.

function Resolve-CachePath {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The deletable cache entry a named file belongs to, plus its full path.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Zig caches are laid out <root>\<bucket>\<hash>...: bucket is a single
        letter ('c' compiler-generated sources, 'o' outputs, 'z' the ZIR
        store), hash is the entry's hex digest. Two shapes exist and both are
        one unit of deletion:

          <root>\<bucket>\<hash>\<file...>   the hash DIRECTORY is deleted --
              removing only the corrupt file would leave the entry's manifest
              saying the entry is intact;
          <root>\<bucket>\<hash>             the hash FILE is the entry itself
              (the /z ZIR store keeps one file per hash), so it is deleted.

        Bucket-letter and hash are both required, so nothing that is not
        hash-addressed content can ever be named. The `p` bucket (fetched
        dependencies) is hash-addressed too, but by a PACKAGE hash rather than
        a hex digest -- `libxev-0.0.0-86vtc4IcEwCqEYxEYoN_3KXmc6A9VLcm22aVImfvecYs`

        silently hide what happened. The tail-shape re-verification is belt and
        braces on top of Resolve-CachePath: this function refuses anything that
        does not end in \<bucket-letter>\<hex-hash> under a *cache* path.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Leave a tell inside a cache entry whose delete could not finish.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Best effort and deliberately quiet on failure: this runs in the arm of
        a heal that has already failed, and a marker that cannot be written
        must not turn into a second error on top of the first. The value is
        for the NEXT reader -- Get-TornPackage reports the marker, so a
        half-removed package is named by `build-cache.ps1 check` instead of
        counting as a healthy entry.
