.SYNOPSIS
    Run a built test binary N times and report how many runs CRASHED. T473.

.DESCRIPTION
    The T443 corruption lands on roughly half of runs, which makes every
    single-run result worthless: "it passed" and "it is fixed" look identical.
    Every claim about that signal therefore needs a run count behind it, and
    this is the thing that produces one.

    It runs the LANE, through `zig build`, and separates the three outcomes
    that a bare exit code smears together. Running the binary straight out of
    .zig-cache is cheaper and was the original behaviour, but T832 measured
    what that costs: the T443 corruption has never once been observed in a
    directly-launched process (~200 runs, 0 crashes -- including the exact
    binary that had dumped three times that morning), against 5 aborts in 26
    build-runner lane runs on the same box on 2026-08-14. `zig build` passes
    `--listen=-`, so `lib/compiler/test_runner.zig` takes `mainServer()` and
    drives one test per pipe message instead of `mainTerminal()`'s back-to-back
    loop -- a different scheduling pattern and a different set of stack
    leftovers under every test. So a standalone soak can report "all clear"
    indefinitely while the defect is still there; it is still available behind
    `-Mode standalone`, and it says so in its own output.

    The three outcomes:

      CRASH   - the process died on an exception. `std.process.Child` truncates
                a Windows exit code to a byte, so this is recognised from the
                stderr signature AND the low-byte NTSTATUS decode, then
                confirmed against the Windows `Application Error` log.
      FAIL    - the tests ran and some failed. A real red test, not a crash.
      PASS    - clean.

    Comparing two configurations (a control arm and a suspect arm) is the whole
    point: pass -Label so the two summaries are told apart in a transcript.

.PARAMETER Lane
    Which lane to soak. In build-runner mode this is the `zig build` target;
    in standalone mode it selects the newest test binary that lane built
    (`agent` covers both agent test binaries, soaking each in turn).

.PARAMETER Mode
    build-runner (the default whenever -Lane is given) repeats the lane through
    `zig build`, which is the only condition T443 has ever been seen in.
    standalone runs the built exe directly -- faster, and structurally unable
    to reproduce T443; it prints a warning saying so. -Exe is always
    standalone, because a bare exe has no lane to build.

.PARAMETER NoCatch
    Build-runner mode only: pass -NoCatch to floor-lane.ps1, so a crashed run
    is not re-run under cdb. Skips a couple of minutes per crash when the crash
    RATE is what is being measured rather than any single stack.

.PARAMETER Concurrency
    Standalone mode only. Run this many copies of the binary AT THE SAME TIME
    per round (default 1, which is the original sequential behaviour). Lane
    runs are never overlapped (T401): a lane starved by another lane wedges,
    and a wedge is not a data point.

    This is not a speed knob, it is the experiment. Every T443 crash was
    observed under `zig build` / `floor-lane.ps1`, which has several test
    processes and compiles in flight at once; every clean run -- 47 of them,
    including the byte-identical binary that produced the 07:13 dump -- was a
    single process on an idle box. A signal that needs the machine
    oversubscribed to appear cannot be soaked for one process at a time, which
    is how 47 runs of a "50% flaky" crash came back green and told us nothing.

.PARAMETER LoadWorkers
    Build-runner mode only. Hold N CPU/allocation-churning worker processes on
    the box for the whole soak, so the lane runs on a BUSY machine.

    This is the other half of the -Concurrency experiment, and it exists
    because T443's two variables were never crossed. Load was tested only in
    standalone mode (32 copies of the crash-day binary at once, 0 crashes) --
    the condition the defect has never once occurred in. The build runner was
    tested only on a quiesced box (15 sequential agent-lane runs on 2026-08-14,
    0 crashes). Yet every abort that task has ever recorded arrived while
    something ELSE was compiling or testing on the box: 5 in 26 runs the same
    morning, then nothing once it went quiet. `build-runner x loaded` is the
    cell with all the sightings in it and no measurement.

    The workers are ordinary processes burning CPU and churning 4 MB
    allocations -- they cannot touch the lane's memory, so what they vary is
    scheduling and memory-manager timing, which is what a latent race needs.
    They self-expire on a deadline as well as being killed at the end, so an
    interrupted soak cannot leave the box loaded.

    -LoadKind chooses WHAT the workers do; see it for the compile-shaped load,
    which is the shape the sightings actually had.

.PARAMETER LoadKind
    What each load worker does. The default `cpu` is the spin+allocate body
    described under -LoadWorkers. The other two run a REAL COMMAND in a loop,
    because CPU load is not the condition T443 was ever seen in:

      build   - each worker loops a cold `zig build` of a test lane, so the box
                carries compiler processes, page faults, disk and heap-manager
                traffic, not just cycles. Every sighting arrived while another
                compile+test lane was running; 16 spin workers cost the measured
                lane only ~13% wall clock (192s -> 217s) and produced 0 crashes
                in 8 runs (T443 turn 6), which is why this exists. Each worker
                gets a PRIVATE local cache and prefix (the build manifest and
                its locks are the hazard) and shares the already-populated
                global package cache, so it compiles this repo's source rather
                than rebuilding freetype on every pass.
      command - each worker loops the command line given by -LoadCommand.

    Both write one line per completed iteration, and the count lands in the
    summary: a load claim nobody measured is exactly what T832 had to unwind.

.PARAMETER LoadCommand
    The command line a `command`-kind worker loops. Giving it implies
    -LoadKind command.

    A load command MUST NOT share the measured lane's zig cache. A second
    `zig build` in this repo takes the same cache manifest locks, so it can
    stall -- or be stalled by -- the lane whose timing is being measured, and a
    wedged lane is not a data point (T401). A `zig build` load command without
    an explicit `--cache-dir` is therefore refused rather than run; `-LoadKind
    build` composes the isolated form for you.

.PARAMETER LoadWorkDir
    Scratch ROOT for command/build workers. Each soak gets its own
    `<label>-<stamp>` directory under it, holding one `w<N>` directory per
    worker: the generated worker script, its log, its iteration file and (build
    kind) its private zig cache. Defaults to a directory on the REPO'S DRIVE,
    because zig 0.15.2 asserts when a global cache lives on a different drive
    than the build's cwd (T243). Private build caches are removed when the soak
    ends; logs are kept.

    The per-soak directory is not tidiness, it is evidence retention (T877): the
    slots used to be flat `w0..wN` cleared at every startup, so each soak
    destroyed the previous soak's worker logs -- including, on 2026-08-15, the
    only record of a worker iteration that had itself crashed.

.PARAMETER LoadDryRun
    Compose the load, print what each worker would run, and exit without
    starting a worker or a round. For checking an isolation flag before
    spending an hour of soak on it.

.OUTPUTS
    A per-run table and a final one-line summary:
        SOAK <label>: mode=M runs=N pass=P fail=F crash=C  crash-rate=C/N (xx%)
    In build-runner mode the summary also carries `load=N:<kind>` and, for a
    command-shaped load, `load-iters=N` and `worker-crash=N` -- because a run
    count that does not name its condition is what T832 had to throw away, and a
    load nobody measured is a condition nobody can check.

    A round counts as CRASH when the lane transcript or the lane log says a test
    binary died, which since T877 includes floor-lane's own decoded
    `-- crash diagnostics --` verdict (a `CRASH ... <test exe> pid=...` line, or
    zig reporting a command that `exited with code 3/5`) and not only handler
    text. `worker-crash=N` is the same question asked of the load workers'
    logs, which each run a real lane and so can crash in the same way; it is
    reported separately because `crash-rate` is per measured ROUND.
    When more than one binary was soaked (-Lane agent standalone), a per-binary
    line follows the summary attributing pass/fail/crash to each exe, and each
    per-run log name carries the exe basename so the two binaries' logs cannot
    overwrite each other (T509).
    Exit 0 = no crashes, 1 = at least one crash, 2 = could not run.
