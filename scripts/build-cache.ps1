.SYNOPSIS
    Keep the zig build caches from filling the repo drive (T1054).

.DESCRIPTION
    Zig never evicts its build cache and this project builds all day, so the
    cache grows ~40 GB a day forever. On 2026-08-21 D: reached exactly 0 bytes
    free with 31,359 entries and 1,235 GB in `.zig-cache\o`, and every floor
    lane then died in five seconds with a bare `error: Unexpected` -- which
    reads as broken code, not as a full disk. A turn can burn its whole context
    on that.

    Actions:

      check   Report the cheap health question and exit 0. Never deletes.
      sweep   Report, and CLEAR the caches when they are over a limit. This is
              what `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim` runs once a turn.
      clear   Clear now, whatever the numbers say.

    `check` and `sweep` also ask whether the fetched packages in the global
    cache look WHOLE, not merely numerous (T1436). On 2026-09-07 the claim
    printed "build cache ok: 1025.8 GB free, 1474 entries" and every build on
    the box was already dead: one package had been half-extracted, and this
    report counted it as an entry like any other. Scanning for that costs ~90ms
    over 1,500 packages and is described in scripts\lib\CacheHeal.ps1.

    They also read every generated source under `c\<hash>\` for the shapes a
    hard reboot leaves (empty, NUL bytes, no trailing newline) (T999). Both
    torn-cache incidents followed an unclean shutdown and were found only when
    a lane went red minutes later; `sweep` - which the claim runs, so it is the
    first thing after a reboot - deletes such an entry so the next build
    regenerates it, and `check` names it.

    Clearing is WHOLE, never by age: pruning `o\` alone leaves Zig's manifests
    in `h\` claiming outputs that no longer exist, and the next build fails
    with `failed to spawn build runner ... FileNotFound`. See
    scripts\lib\BuildCache.ps1 for the full argument and the measurements.

    Exit codes: 0 ok (including "over, and cleared"), 2 error. Being over a
    limit is never a nonzero exit -- this runs inside the claim, and a claim
    that can fail over housekeeping wedges the loop, which is the disease and
    not the cure.
