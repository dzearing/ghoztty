.SYNOPSIS
    Run a standing-floor test lane under a watchdog that can tell a SLOW run
    from a WEDGED one, and never returns without an answer (T430).

.DESCRIPTION
    Two of the four standing-floor lanes (`zig build test -Dapp-runtime=win32`
    and `zig build test-agent`) have hung indefinitely with no output and no
    timeout. A hang that cannot be told apart from slowness is worse than a red
    test: a turn either waits forever, or kills its own run and reads the kill
    as a regression it caused.

    This wrapper gives every lane a bounded, diagnosed ending:

      * It sets ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR on the repo's own drive before launching,
        because a detached `cmd.exe` does not inherit a `$env:` var set in an
        earlier shell and the resulting failure reads as a corrupt cache
        ("unable to read results of configure phase ... FileNotFound") rather
        than as anything mentioning drives.
      * It logs through cmd.exe redirection (unbuffered), so a killed run still
        has its output on disk. PowerShell's own `*>` buffers, and `Stop-Job`
        discards the buffer -- that is how two earlier hang investigations
        produced zero bytes.
      * It watches CPU, not just the clock. A lane that is *computing* burns
        CPU; a lane that is *wedged* does not. Zero CPU delta across the whole
        process tree for -StallSeconds, with no new log output, is a wedge and
        is reported as one.
      * On a wedge (or the wall-clock cap) it dumps a diagnostic FIRST -- the
        process tree with CPU times, every thread's wait reason, any WebView2
        hosts, and the log tail -- and only then kills the tree.
      * It sweeps leaked `msedgewebview2.exe` processes, which are invisible to
        a sweep that filters on zig-out/zig-cache paths (that exe lives under
        Program Files). Match on `--webview-exe-name=` and on the private
        `ghoztty-wv2test-<pid>` profile the whole browser tree carries.
      * It WAITS for those processes to be gone before starting the next lane
        (T592). Two lanes stand up a real WebView2 environment and `-Lane all`
        starts the next the instant the previous exits; asking for an
        environment through a teardown answers `hr=0x80004005`, which read as a
        red floor three times. See scripts\lib\WebViewLane.ps1.
      * It counts -- and explains, and reaps -- the lane's own TEST BINARIES
        when they outlive the verdict (T837). The agent lane was measured
        leaving `ghoztty-agent-test.exe` and the since-removed (T434)
        `ghoztty-agent-core-test.exe` alive 25 minutes past `LANE agent PASS`,
        wedged with frozen CPU, and
        nothing looked: the webview sweep above filters on a different exe
        entirely. Every run now ends with a `leaked test binaries: N` number,
        so a recurrence is counted rather than noticed by accident, and each
        leak gets a non-invasive `cdb` stack before it is killed. See
        scripts\lib\LaneLeak.ps1.
      * It self-heals a torn zig-cache entry (T494): a FAIL whose compile
        errors point into `.zig-cache\` or the global cache is a half-written
        cache file, not red code -- the entry is deleted (loudly, as
        `CACHE HEAL` lines) and the lane re-run ONCE; the re-run's verdict is
        final. See scripts\lib\CacheHeal.ps1.
      * It says when the COMPILER crashed, and retries once (T451). `zig.exe`
        itself takes access violations on this box -- eight in the 32 days to
        2026-09-04 -- and the lane then dies on a bare `exited with error code
        5` that reads exactly like broken code. A `COMPILER CRASH` block names
        the fault, the lane is re-run once, and the re-run is final. A crash in
        one of OUR test binaries vetoes all of that, because that red is ours.
        See scripts\lib\CompilerCrash.ps1.

.PARAMETER Lane
    none | win32 | agent | lib | all. Default `all` runs the four zig lanes in
    sequence.

    `lib` is the odd one out: it BUILDS rather than tests, and it is here
    because nothing else on this box compiles the shared core for the
    msvc-target `lib ghostty` artifact. POSIX-only code can therefore enter
    `src/` and every lane people run stays green -- `zig build
    -Dapp-runtime=none` was red for weeks over four such call sites in
    `src/remote/ssh_transport.zig` (T475), and the test lanes could not see it
    because the tests that reach them `SkipZigTest` on Windows, which stops
    Zig analyzing the bodies. A cached run costs about a second; it only
    compiles anything when the shared core actually moved, which is exactly
    when the canary is worth having.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    Wall-clock cap per lane run. Default 1800.

.PARAMETER StallSeconds
    Zero-CPU-delta window that counts as wedged. Default 420 -- see the comment
    on the parameter for the measurement that set it.

.PARAMETER Repeat
    Run each lane this many times (T430's validation asks for 10 consecutive
    clean runs). A failing or wedged run stops the repeat.

.OUTPUTS
    One `LANE <name> <RESULT> ...` line per run and a final summary line.
    Exit code: 0 all passed, 1 a lane failed, 2 a lane wedged, 3 a lane hit the
    wall-clock cap.

# --------------------------------------------- compiler-crash retry (T451)

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Report a lane that died because zig.exe crashed, and re-run it once.

.DESCRIPTION
The retry POLICY, kept apart from the classifier in lib\CompilerCrash.ps1 so
the decision can be tested against planted crash records without running a
lane. It reads the verdict Invoke-Lane left in $script:LastLaneCompilerCrash,
which is why every caller gets the same behaviour whether it came through the
lane loop or through -Command.

The budget is one retry per lane per invocation, exactly like the cache heal:
a compiler that crashes twice over the same code is no longer distinguishable
from code that does not compile, and a wrapper that retries forever cannot
report anything.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Heals a torn cache entry a red run blamed, and re-runs once.

.DESCRIPTION
The T494 policy, lifted out of the lane loop so `-Command` mode runs it too
(T1436). It lived inline in the loop, which meant the only mode a test can
fixture -- `-Command`, which drives a real process through the wrapper -- was
the one mode that could not demonstrate a heal end to end. The rules are
unchanged: at most ONE heal per lane per invocation, and the re-run's verdict
is final, so a genuine failure simply fails again.

# ------------------------------------------------- solo confirm pass (T1170)

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Re-runs a red lane narrowed to the tests it blamed, and says whether they
reproduce on their own.

.DESCRIPTION
The T1137 rule, applied to lanes instead of to the acceptance suite. A lane
that is red because 5000+ tests and a live WebView2 were competing for the box
is NOT the same event as a lane that is red because the code is broken, and
until this ran every turn had to discover the difference by hand - which is
what T1170 cost. The verdict is unchanged either way: red is still red and the
exit code is still non-zero. What changes is that the answer is IN the run.
