# Commit guard for a SHARED working tree (tracker T948).
#
# Two Claude windows are the normal arrangement on this box - the go-loop
# window plus an unmarked window filing tasks or auditing (go.md step 0 never
# closes the unmarked one). They share one working tree, which means they share
# one INDEX, and `git commit` commits the index rather than "my work".
#
# On 2026-08-17 that cost T850 its own commit: the loop window had staged
# exactly its eight paths and was composing the message when the other window
# committed with `-A`. Git did what it was told - it committed the index, which
# by then held both sets of changes - so a whole clipboard fix landed under a
# subject describing none of it, and it was pushed before anyone noticed. Three
# things break when that happens: the dashboard's activity feed describes the
# wrong change, `set-status -Commit <sha>` points a task at a misleading
# artifact, and an unfinished edit from the other window can ship.
#
# Two mechanisms, deliberately independent, because either one alone still
# loses:
#
#   PREVENT - an advisory lock held across the stage->commit window (seconds),
#             enforced on everybody else by the `pre-commit` hook in
#             scripts\githooks. The holder's own git children carry
#             GHOZTTY_COMMIT_LOCK_KEY and pass through; another session's commit
#             is REFUSED with the remedy in the message. A lock older than its
#             ttl is stale and is cleared rather than obeyed, so a crashed
#             holder cannot wedge the repo.
#
#   DETECT  - `commit` reads the finished commit back and proves it contains
#             ONLY the paths it was asked to commit. A session that bypasses
#             the hook (--no-verify, a git that ignores hooksPath, a hook that
#             was never installed) still cannot make this quiet: the swallow is
#             named, with the sha, before the turn moves on. Prevention that is
#             only as good as the other window's cooperation is not a gate.
#
# The commit itself uses an explicit PATHSPEC (`git commit -- <paths>`), which
# ignores whatever else is sitting in the shared index. That is what keeps the
# theft from running in the other direction as well.
#
# One thing `commit` deliberately cannot carry: an INDEX-ONLY change, such as a
# mode bit set with `git update-index --chmod=+x` (core.filemode is false on
# Windows, so that is the only way to record one). A pathspec commit takes the
# WORKING TREE content of its paths and ignores the index, which is exactly what
# makes it immune to the other window - and equally blind to a staged mode. For
# those, hold the lock and commit the index yourself:
#
#   $k = 'modebit'
#   scripts\git-commit-guard.ps1 hold -Key $k
#   $env:GHOZTTY_COMMIT_LOCK_KEY = $k; git commit -m '...'
#   scripts\git-commit-guard.ps1 release -Force
#
# PUSHING IS PART OF COMMITTING (T1057). `commit` pushes by default and
# `-NoPush` is the way out, because the other arrangement is the one that
# failed: the rule "push immediately after every commit" is go.md step 4, it is
# what makes a commit visible to the other seat and survivable across a dead
# box, and with `-Push` as an opt-in it stayed honour-system - the user had to
# state it twice (2026-08-07, 2026-08-21). A rule restated is a rule not
# enforced. `unpushed` is the same question asked at a turn boundary, and it is
# wired into both ends of the turn: go-loop-exec.ps1's claim reports it, and
# parity-tasks.ps1's validate FAILS on it, so a finished task cannot be
# narrated over a commit that never left this machine.
