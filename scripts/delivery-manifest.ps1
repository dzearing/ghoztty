# What a Windows delivery CONSISTS of, as pure functions (tracker T198).
#
# The three install locations are the installed release, the Desktop portable
# and the network share; only the first has ever been scripted. The other two
# were re-derived from prose in the session log by whichever session was doing
# the delivery, and T196 is the evidence that costs correctness rather than
# time: a hand-built portable zip exited 0 and was wrong twice over - rooted at
# `Ghoztty-portable-x64\Ghoztty\...` instead of `Ghoztty\...`, and carrying both
# `.pdb` files, doubling a network-share download from 20.3 MB to 41.9 MB.
#
# So the SET of things a delivery ships is written down once, here, as data a
# test can assert on, and `deliver-windows-build.ps1` is the only consumer that
# turns it into file copies. Everything in this file is pure: no filesystem, no
# processes, no network. That is what lets the acceptance script check the rules
# without touching a real install location.

# The files a delivery copies into a portable install directory, in the order a
# reader would expect to see them logged.
#
# -AppOnly ships the app and nothing else. The agent outlives the app on
# purpose, and an agent swapped underneath a portable copy would hand the
# mandatory agent-restart confirmation to whoever launches it next -
# "app-only except over there" is the per-location divergence this repo does
# not ship.
#
# It used to be the morning refresh's mode (T525). That script was retired by
# D85 - nothing in this repo replaces the user's installed terminal any more -
# so -AppOnly has no automatic caller left: it reaches the scripts only through
# a hand-run `launch-upgrade.ps1 -ExtraArgs '-AppOnly'`. The route an agent fix
# actually takes to the user is the daily publish, and build-msi.sh's package
# both REQUIRES ghoztty-agent.exe and versions it alongside ghoztty.exe, so the
# in-app updater installs the agent from the same build as the app (T913,
# asserted by A14a/A14b2 in test\win32\release-artifacts.ps1).
function Get-DeliveryFileSet {

    # ghoztty.com is NOT optional (T245): PATHEXT resolves .COM before .EXE, so

#
# `share\` has always been one; `gl\` joined it with T1252, and the reason it is
# a tree here rather than two more names in the file set above is that the file
# set is flat - every entry is copied from `<staging>\bin\<name>` to
# `<target>\<name>` with no directory creation - and `gl` lives at
# `<staging>\bin\gl` and must land at `<target>\gl`. Mirroring is also the right
# semantics for it: a Mesa version bump changes which files are there, and a
# leftover from the previous one is a DLL the loader might still open.
#
# gl\ is deliberately in the -AppOnly set too: it is part of the app, not of the
# agent, and an app delivered without it refuses to start on exactly the
