.SYNOPSIS
  Query and create Windows-parity tasks stored one-file-per-task under
  docs/design/windows-parity-tasks/.

.DESCRIPTION
  Replaces the single-file state table. Each task is <id>.md with YAML
  frontmatter (id, title, order, deps, status, commits, seat, priority) plus a Summary
  and optional Details body. One file per task means two agents can add and
  edit tasks concurrently without touching the same file.

  SEATS (T344). A task's `seat:` says which box can actually do it: `win` (the
  Windows box, and the default when the field is absent), `mac` (needs a macOS
  build/run), or `any`. `next` and `list` filter on it so the Windows loop is
  never handed a task whose validation starts "Mac regression build" - which is
  a permanent stall, since `next` is a pure function of the files.

  ASCII-only by design (PS 5.1 on this box mangles non-ASCII on rewrite).

  EVERY STATUS CHANGE IS JOURNALED (T564). `set-status` appends the transition
  ("status: blocked(...) -> todo") to the task's own `## Progress log`, with
  `-SourceNote` naming whoever asked for it. A status flip is what puts work in
  the queue and takes it out, and it used to be the one edit that left no trace:
  on 2026-08-07 a one-click reopen of T443's armed watch was indistinguishable
  from an evidence-backed one, and it also discarded the `blocked(reason)` text.
  The note preserves the old status verbatim, reason included. `-NoNote` opts a
  bulk normalisation pass out; nothing else should.

  AND IT IS ALWAYS ATTRIBUTED (T861). Omitting `-SourceNote` no longer means an
  anonymous line: the journal falls back to a source synthesized from the user,
  the parent process and the working directory ("by cli: David, from pwsh, in
  ghoztty"). The CLI was the last writer that could edit the queue and leave a
  whodunit behind; a reopen that cost the following turn its opening minutes is
  why that matters. The fallback is attribution, not evidence - the un-block
  gate below still demands a real `-SourceNote`.

  UN-BLOCKING NEEDS EVIDENCE (T892). Moving a task OUT of `blocked(...)` is the
  transition that puts work back in front of the loop, and it asserts something
  nobody checked: that the park condition is now satisfied. `set-status`
  therefore refuses that transition without `-SourceNote` saying what was
  checked, and prints the task's `unblock:` text so the caller sees the
  condition they are claiming. Every other transition is untouched.

  IS THIS TASK STILL TRUE? (T404). A todo is a claim about the code made on the
  day it was filed, and nothing re-checked it: T98 was handed out fourteen days
  after T41 had already fixed its defect at the source. `next` now prints the
  filing date and any commits that have touched the files the task itself names
  since, and `stale-scan` asks the same question of the whole queue - ranked by
  a later commit having NAMED the task by id, then oldest first. Both are
  prompts to verify, never verdicts.

  AND IS IT ALREADY FILED? (T651). `new` used to allocate an id and write a
  file with no lookup of any kind, so the same defect could be filed three
  times - the T400 stale-debounce flake went in as T615, then T643, then T649
  on consecutive days, each by a turn that had just watched the lane go red and
  had no cheap way to ask "is this known?". `new` now NAMES existing tasks
  whose titles look like the one being filed, before it writes anything, and
  `similar` asks that question on its own. It warns and never blocks: a false
  positive that refused to file would lose a mid-turn report, which is worse
  than a duplicate.

# after T41 had already fixed its defect at the source, and the loop spent a
# whole context discovering that. The expensive version of the same shape is a
# task a later fix only PARTLY repaired, where the next agent implements over

# names since it was made. It is a prompt to verify, never a verdict - a task
# whose files moved may still be entirely open, and an untouched one may have
# been fixed somewhere else. `next` prints it for the one task it hands out;
# `stale-scan` prints it for the whole queue so a sweep is a report rather than

        # queuing and task recording to use priority for figuring out what to
        # prioritize!! This is critical").
        #
        # `priority:` is what the work is WORTH; `order:` is only the sequence
        # within a band. Sorting by order first inverted that, and it did it
        # invisibly, because an unplaced task ranks MaxValue: a P0 with no
        # `order:` sorted behind every positioned P2 on the board. On
        # 2026-08-11 that left three P0s the user had reported by hand sitting
        # `todo` for a full day while twenty-four P2 test-harness tasks closed
        # in front of them, and it took hand-sorting the queue on three
        # consecutive mornings to work around it.
        #
        # The consequence that makes this the right way round: a task filed
        # with nothing but a priority is placed correctly the moment it is
        # filed. Under the old rule it needed a hand-assigned position to be
        # reachable at all, so the queue only worked as well as the last person
        # who remembered to renumber it - and 70 open P1s carried no position.
        #
        # `order:` keeps its job inside the band: it is how triage sequences
        # the P0s against each other, and `set-order` still injects between two
        # of them without renumbering. What it can no longer do is outrank
        # importance. Id remains the last tiebreaker, so the ordering is total
        # and deterministic no matter how little is filled in.
