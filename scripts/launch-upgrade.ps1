# Launch upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1 detached, and PROVE it started (T200).
#
# T1218 / decision D85 (2026-08-31): what this launches is a DEV delivery now.
# The user's installed Ghoztty is no longer swapped by anything in this repo -
# only the in-app updater replaces it, and only with a published release. To get
# today's work to the user, publish it (scripts\publish-windows-release.ps1);
# this path exists for a dev install the loop owns.
#
# The delivery at a task boundary is fire-and-forget by necessity: nothing in
# the Claude session's process tree can swap the exe out from under its own GUI,
# so the upgrade has to outlive the turn that starts it. That makes the launch
# the one step no one is watching, and on 2026-07-30 it failed with zero
# evidence anywhere - `Start-Process -ArgumentList @(...)` does not quote its
# elements, so a multi-word -ResumePrompt was re-tokenized into positional
# arguments and PowerShell rejected the bind BEFORE the script's first line ran.
# Nothing was logged (the script never started), and nothing was printed (the
# child was detached and hidden). The turn reported "upgrading now" and the loop
# sat dead for 45 minutes until the T139 watchdog re-entered it.
#
# So this wrapper does four things the open-coded incantation cannot:
#
#   1. the prompt travels as a FILE, never through argv, so no quoting, hyphen,
#      %VAR%, quote or newline in it can reach the parameter binder;
#   2. it gates success on the child's OUTPUT - a NEW `=== upgrade start` line
#      in the upgrade log - not on Start-Process returning a process object.
#      Failing here is the whole point: the launching turn is the last moment
#      anyone is still watching.
#   3. it BUILDS the staging release first (T208). The upgrade script never
#      builds - it copies whatever sits in the staging prefix - and that
#      precondition was documented nowhere the caller reads, so a delivery
#      shipped the previous delivery's binary with every signal reporting OK.
#   4. it refuses to launch unless the staged exe's baked commit IS this tree's
#      HEAD, and hands that commit to the child so the pre-swap abort and the
#      post-swap check measure the same number.
#
# Usage - call it IN-PROCESS so -Prompt binds as one string:
#
#   & D:\git\ghoztty\scripts\launch-upgrade.ps1 `
#       -Prompt '/reset-context <verify this delivery...> Then read go.md and go'
#
# Across a command line (`powershell -File ...`) the very shredding described
# above applies to THIS script's own -Prompt too, so use -PromptFile there.
# Either way a mis-bind is loud: PositionalBinding=$false means a stray word is
# rejected by name instead of landing in -LoopClaudePid.
#
# Exits 0 once the upgrade is confirmed RUNNING (not finished - it deliberately
# outlives this process), non-zero with the child's stderr if it never started.
