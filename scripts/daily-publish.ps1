# The end-of-day Windows publish (tracker T1220).
#
# THE PROBLEM. Decision D85 (2026-08-31) settled who owns the user's terminal:
# "the terminal should only ever run something that was actually published".
# T1218 then removed the morning swap that used to push repo bits straight into
# the installed app. That was the right call and it came with a promise: the
# loop PUBLISHES at the end of a day's work, so today's fixes still reach the
# user today, through the ordinary in-app updater. Without this script that
# promise is a sentence in a task file: the work lands on the branch and sits
# there until somebody types a publish command by hand.
#
# THE TRIGGER is the same shape as the retired morning refresh's, moved to the
# other end of the day: a real signal (the loop's task-boundary push) rather
# than a clock alone, at most once per local day, with a durable watermark. A
# clock alone would fire into whatever half-finished tree happened to be checked
# out; a task-boundary push is the loop saying "this commit is good". The hour
# is the EVENING (17:00 local by default) rather than the morning, because the
# point is that a fix which landed today ships today - a morning publish would
# always be shipping yesterday.
#
# AND A CATCH-UP RULE, because the evening hour assumes a workday this loop does
# not have (T1292). On 2026-09-02 the loop's last push was at 14:28 and it then
# stalled: 17:00 never arrived while anything was running, so the day published
# nothing and said nothing. A wall-clock gate inside a process with no schedule
# is a coin flip. So a publish is ALSO due at the first task-boundary push once
# -StaleHours (24 by default) have passed since the last one, whatever the hour.
# The evening rule still shapes a normal day; the catch-up rule is what makes
# "work ships within a day" true rather than aspirational, and it is what fires
# on the morning after a day that died early.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, once a day: run scripts\publish-windows-tag.ps1, which puts the
# win-v<Version> tag on HEAD and pushes it to origin. The Release (Windows)
# workflow then builds the MSI + portable ZIP on ubuntu-latest and creates the
# release. The installed terminal's update check scans for the newest win-v tag,
# so that release IS the delivery.
#
# WHY A TAG PUSH AND NOT A LOCAL BUILD (T1292). Until 2026-09-03 this ran
# scripts\publish-windows-release.ps1, which packages the MSI with wixl inside
# the msitools Docker image. wixl does not run on Windows, so that path requires
# Docker Desktop - and Docker Desktop is deliberately kept down on this box (its
# WSL2 backend once took 28 GB and buried the machine), which is exactly why
# every script here says starting it is the user's call. The result was a
# publish that asked every evening for a precondition it was structurally
# forbidden to satisfy: it wrote a polite SKIP into a temp log and shipped
# nothing, for three days, while nineteen tasks closed. A step whose failure mode
# is "nothing happens" is the worst kind, so the dependency is gone rather than
# excused. -Local reinstates the old path for a box that genuinely wants to
# package locally.
#
# AND AN ON-DEMAND RULE, because one publish per day strands everything that
# lands after it (T1294). On 2026-09-03 the day's release went out at 09:28, the
# fix for the installer bug the user had just reported landed at 11:01, and the
# 18:19 run answered `NOT DUE: already published today` - so the user downloaded
# the same broken installer a second time and reported the same bug again, with
# 24 commits sitting behind that date. The daily cadence is the FLOOR (work ships
# at least once a day), not the CEILING. So a turn that lands something somebody
# is waiting for records a request:
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\daily-publish.ps1 -Request ^
#       -Reason "T1291: the installer dies silently on a same-version install"
#
# which publishes nothing itself - the next task-boundary run, seconds later in
# the loop and after the commit is pushed, sees it and publishes despite the
# date. The noise guard survives intact, because an ordinary turn files no
# request and still gets exactly one release a day. A request with nothing behind
# it (HEAD is already the published commit) is cleared rather than honoured, so
# "ship it" can never mint an empty release.
#
# AND A SIZE RULE, because both of those requests are keyed on somebody having
# reported something (T1588). A busy morning with no report behind it banked 37
# commits behind a release that had already gone out. So a gap of
# -StrandedThreshold commits behind a PUBLISHED release files the same request
# itself, reason `stranded threshold: ...`, and the next lines treat it exactly
# like a hand-filed one. Still not publish-per-commit: the threshold is half a
# working day.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES: touch the installed app. See scripts\install-ownership.ps1
# and decision D85. Publishing is the only delivery path this repo has.
#
# SKIPS ARE NOT FAILURES. What a publish needs that this loop cannot arrange is
# now down to one thing: HEAD must already be on the remote (it always is, since
# the commit guard pushes). Under -Local the old pair comes back - Docker
# Desktop up, `gh` authenticated. A missing precondition is a SKIP with the
# reason named in the log, the watermark is NOT consumed (so a later push the
# same day can still publish), and the loop carries on. The one thing that must
# never happen is a publish attempt stalling the turn.
#
# A SKIP IS ALSO NOT INVISIBLE ANY MORE. `publish=` on
# scripts\go-loop-health.ps1 reads the watermark and reports ok / due /
# stale-<n>d / failed / never, and degrades the run when nothing has shipped for
# a day. That is the same shape as `digest=` (T1223) and it exists for the same
# reason: the three-day outage had to be noticed by the user.
#
# HOW THE CALLER USES IT (go.md step 6.5):
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\daily-publish.ps1
#
#   exit 0  -> not due, or skipped with a named reason. Finish the turn.
#   exit 10 -> published (tag printed). Finish the turn.
#   exit 1  -> it was due and the publish failed. Nothing was released; finish
#              the turn normally so a bad publish cannot stall the loop.
#
# And two calls that publish nothing at all:
#
#   -Request -Reason "<why>"  record that work is waiting; the next run ships it.
#   -Status                   what shipped, and every commit that has landed
#                             since - the digest's stranded-work line.
#
# VERSION SCHEME (the thing this script decides, so nobody has to remember it).
# A Windows release is `win-v<X.Y.Z>`; the Mac releases are `v<X.Y.Z>` in the
# same repo. The daily publish takes the Mac line as its base and walks the
# PATCH:
#
#   base = the newest vX.Y.Z Mac release tag
#   if there is no win-v release at or above `base` -> publish base itself
#   otherwise -> publish the newest win-v version with its patch + 1
#
# So a Mac v1.37.0 is followed by win-v1.37.0, then win-v1.37.1, win-v1.37.2 ...
# one per publishing day, until the next Mac release pulls the base up again.
# The consequences that matter: the version the user sees says which Mac line
# their Windows build corresponds to; the daily walk never squats on a Mac minor
# the Mac seat has not released yet; MSI upgrade ordering stays monotonic; and
# the chosen version can never collide with an existing release, because it is
# derived from the set of releases that exist. `publish-windows-release.ps1`
# refuses an existing tag as a second line of defence.
#
# WATERMARK. %LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\daily-publish, one JSON object recording the
# local date, the instant, the tag, the commit and the outcome of the last
# publish. The date is what the due decision reads; the instant is what the
# catch-up rule measures; the rest is what the morning digest and the health
# line read to answer "is what I am running the work I read about yesterday?". A
# plain yyyy-MM-dd line is still accepted, so an older watermark is not a reason
# to publish twice, and a watermark with no `at` falls back to its date at the
# cutoff hour.
#
# THE TAG IS NOT THE RELEASE, so the watermark records `tagged` and the NEXT run
# confirms it. CI builds for ten minutes after the push, and a run that goes red
# leaves a tag with no release behind it - which used to be indistinguishable
# from a successful publish. Every invocation re-checks a `tagged` watermark
# against `gh release view` and rewrites it to `published` or `failed`, so the
# health line tells the truth about what actually shipped rather than about what
# was attempted.
#
# AND A FAILED ATTEMPT DOES NOT CONSUME THE DAY (T1369). Knowing an attempt
# failed was worth nothing while the DUE calculation still read only the date:
# on 2026-09-05 win-v1.36.13 was tagged, its Release (Windows) run died on
# T1364's wixl sequencing bug, the fix landed an hour later on the same branch,
# and every run for the rest of the day answered `already published today` over
# a day that had shipped nothing at all. So a watermark whose outcome is
# `failed` (or `attempting`, which is a run that died mid-publish) is NOT a
# publish, and the next task-boundary push publishes the branch as it now
# stands. Two bounds keep that from becoming a tag per push on a branch that is
# simply red: the head must have MOVED since the attempt that did not land - a
# retry over the same tree would fail the same way - and a day may make at most
# -MaxAttemptsPerDay attempts. The failed tag is left where it is; the retry
# walks to the next patch, because a tag naming a commit is not a lie, it is
# just a build nobody could make.
