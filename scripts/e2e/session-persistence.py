"""
E2E harness for Ghoztty session persistence (design doc §5, tasks T07 + T08).

Builds the headlineAcceptance scenario against the DEBUG build entirely via the
debug CLI, then terminates the app and relaunches it, asserting that every pane's
process survived (re-attached, not restarted), the split topology and ratios are
restored exactly, and scrollback replays. Repeats the terminate/relaunch cycle N
times to prove repeatability (incl. 0s fast-relaunch, which T06b made safe).

Modes:
  * default (T07): SIGKILL the app, relaunch the SAME on-disk binary.
  * --upgrade (T08): between terminate and relaunch, REPLACE the app bundle on
    disk with a freshly-versioned, re-signed copy (main-exec sha genuinely
    changes each cycle) — exactly the on-disk swap Sparkle performs — then
    relaunch from the replaced bundle. Proves an upgrade re-attaches intact and
    leaves the agent process untouched.
  * --relaunch=restore|rerun: which `session-relaunch` policy the reboot modes
    (--agent-restart / --agent-only) assert. `restore` (default, and the app's
    default so no flag is passed) = the pane comes back as a plain login shell in
    the recorded cwd with a "session was lost" notice and NO command re-run;
    `rerun` = the recorded command re-executes, the pre-`restore` behavior.
  * --quit=kill|graceful: how the app is terminated each cycle. `graceful` uses
    AppleScript `quit` (routes through applicationShouldTerminate → isQuitting,
    manifest preserved) instead of SIGKILL. Both must survive.

Exit 0 = all criteria passed. Nonzero = a criterion failed (actionable diff printed).

    scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py [--cycles=3] [--upgrade] [--quit=kill|graceful] [--keep] [--verbose]
    scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --fallback   # T19: agent-unavailable exec fallback (default-on)

NEVER touches /Applications/Ghoztty.app. Debug bundle + debug socket + debug agent
only. --upgrade stages/replaces a COPY of the bundle under a temp dir; the
freshly-built zig-out bundle is only ever read. See
docs/design/session-persistence-tasks.json for the full protocol.

# The headline bug: on relaunch the app replayed the agent's whole ~2MB byte
# ring and RE-PARSED it from scratch per pane. Measured on an M-series Mac:
# empty ring 0.74s vs full ring 2.78s (scales with content, >10s with real
# output). The fix persists the app's OWN parsed screen state on (graceful)
# quit and re-attaches at the byte offset it reflects, so the agent replays only
# the tiny gap. This check proves the ring size no longer drives restore time.
