# Session-persistence E2E harness

Automated end-to-end tests for the hybrid local-agent session persistence
(design doc §5). They drive the **debug** build entirely through the debug CLI,
kill the app, relaunch, and assert mechanically that every pane's process
**survived and re-attached** (was not restarted).

> Debug bundle / debug socket / debug agent only. These scripts never touch
> `/Applications/Ghoztty.app`. Build first: `zig build -Doptimize=Debug`.

## `session-persistence.py` — kill -9 survival (task T07)

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py [--cycles=3] [--upgrade | --agent-restart | --agent-only] [--quit=kill|graceful] [--keep] [--verbose]
```

What it does:

1. **Full reset** — kills any debug app + local agent, clears the layout
   manifest and agent port file for a known-clean start.
2. **Builds the headline scenario** — 2 windows, 5 panes, nested split topology
   with distinct ratios:
   - Window A: `P0 | (P1 / P2)` — root ratio 0.30, sub ratio 0.70
   - Window B: `P3 | P4` — ratio 0.40

   Each pane runs a unique never-exiting marker:
   `echo PANE=<n> PID=$$; i=0; while true; do echo tick-<n>-$((i++)); sleep 1; done`
3. **N kill/relaunch cycles** (default 3) — `SIGKILL`s the app and relaunches
   the *same* binary with 0s gap (T06b made fast relaunch safe), polling until
   every pane re-attaches.
4. **Asserts each cycle** (exits nonzero + prints an actionable diff on any miss):
   - every pane's PID unchanged **and** still alive (re-attached, not restarted)
   - tick counter strictly increases across the gap; exactly one `PANE=` line in
     scrollback (a second one ⇒ the shell restarted)
   - split topology deep-equal — directions + ratios within ±0.01
   - window count and per-window marker set preserved
   - pre-gap scrollback line replayed after restore
   - kill→interactive gap < 10s
   - the local agent PID is unchanged (agent owned the PTYs across the swap)
   - live output RESUMES: each pane's tick passes its pre-kill value within 6 s
     (right after a crash restore a pane may show a slightly older persisted
     frame for a moment; what fails is a pane that stays there)
   - no persisted re-attach offset (`screenSnapshotOffset`) is ahead of the
     agent's stream head (the end of the ring the agent wrote at the
     disconnect). An over-counted offset made the next re-attach discard real
     output — the pane that froze after an app restart; 1.37.0's code fails this
     by ~2x on the second cycle.

Panes are identified across restore by their `PANE=<n>` marker, not by IPC name,
so unnamed panes that get fresh auto-registered names on restore are handled.

By default the harness cleans up (closes windows, resets state) on exit; pass
`--keep` to leave the restored fixture running for inspection.

### Notes / gotchas encoded here

- The Ghoztty CLI requires `--flag=value` syntax; `--flag value` silently drops
  the value (e.g. leaves a window unnamed).
- `+split --name=` registers the pane asynchronously on agent-backed windows, so
  the harness polls `+list` for a name before using it as a target.
- The fresh-launch fallback "initial window" is closed after Window A exists (so
  closing it can't quit the app), leaving exactly the 2 test windows in the
  manifest.

## `session-persistence.py --upgrade` — simulated binary upgrade (task T08)

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --upgrade [--quit=kill|graceful] [--cycles=3]
```

Same scenario and assertions as above, but between terminating the app and
relaunching it, the **installed bundle is physically replaced on disk** — every
file unlinked and rewritten with fresh inodes at the same installed path — exactly
the on-disk swap an updater (Sparkle) performs. The app then relaunches from the
replaced bundle and must re-attach every pane intact, with the **agent process
untouched** (same PID before and after the swap). Each cycle asserts the main
executable's inode actually changed (proof the bundle was replaced).

Both termination modes are covered:

- `--quit=kill` (default) — `SIGKILL`, i.e. crash-then-upgrade.
- `--quit=graceful` — AppleScript `quit` (scoped by bundle id, never by process
  name — the release app shares the name), routing through
  `applicationShouldTerminate` (`isQuitting` ⇒ manifest preserved).

The `<10s` SLA is measured as the **recovery** gap (old process gone →
all panes interactive), reported separately from how long termination itself
takes (`term=…s`), since recovery speed — not quit speed — is the crash/upgrade
criterion.

**Why the swapped bundle is byte-identical (not a recompiled binary):** the debug
build is *ad-hoc* signed (no team), so its keychain authorization for
`com.dzearing.ghoztty.relay-account` is bound to the app's exact code hash
(cdhash). A genuinely-recompiled or re-signed bundle has a different cdhash and
would trigger a keychain re-auth **prompt on every launch**. Real Developer-ID
upgrades keep a stable designated requirement and don't prompt; we can't
replicate that ad-hoc. Holding the bytes constant is immaterial to what the test
proves — the restore path never reads app-bundle bytes; it reads the layout
manifest + the surviving agent. The test still exercises the full
FS-swap → relaunch → re-attach path an upgrade takes. The harness verifies the
reserve copy's cdhash matches the installed one before starting.

### Known caveat: slow graceful quit with many agent-backed panes (task T08a)

With several session-persistence (agent-backed) panes open, a **graceful** quit
can hang ~45s in AppKit's `-[NSApplication _terminateFromSender:…saveWindows:]`
window-teardown before the process exits (plain exec-backed windows quit in
<1s). The `isQuitting` manifest-preservation path runs *before* the hang, so
persistence is unaffected, and recovery after relaunch is still <4s — but the
harness waits out the hang (up to 45s) then `SIGKILL`s as a last resort. This is
a pre-existing app-teardown issue tracked as T08a, not a persistence regression.

## `session-persistence.py --agent-restart` — reboot-equivalent (task T12d)

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --agent-restart [--cycles=3] [--relaunch=restore|rerun]
```

The **reboot floor** (design ACs 3 & 4). A reboot — or an agent crash — is the
one scenario no design can keep processes alive across: when the agent dies, its
children die (POSIX PTY semantics) and its in-RAM output ring is gone. The honest
contract is *session state restores + processes **relaunch***, not survival. This
variant proves it end to end:

1. **Setup** — same 2-window / 5-pane fixture. The app installs a per-user
   **LaunchAgent** (`com.dzearing.ghoztty.debug.agent`, `RunAtLoad`+`KeepAlive`)
   so launchd — not the app — owns the agent.
2. **Reboot** — `SIGKILL` **both** the app and the agent (a reboot takes down
   everything). launchd's `KeepAlive` restarts the agent; the fresh agent loads
   `sessions.json` and materializes every session as a *relaunchable tombstone*
   before it accepts connections.
3. **Recover** — relaunch the app. It rebuilds the layout from the manifest,
   re-attaches each leaf by session id, and fires `RELAUNCH` per pane; what the
   agent respawns is decided by `session-relaunch` (see below).

Each cycle asserts the **opposite** of the survival tests: the agent PID
**changed** (launchd brought a new one, in ≤ 5 s — measured 0–2 s), every pane's
child PID is **new** (relaunched, not re-attached), the pane shows the
`--- session restarted ---` banner (the agent bakes it into the replayed ring
snapshot, so it appears under either policy), the pre-restart scrollback is
present above it, and the split topology is still rebuilt exactly from the
manifest.

**`--relaunch` — which `session-relaunch` policy to prove.** The two policies
disagree about exactly one thing: what the fresh child *is*.

- `--relaunch=restore` (the default, and the app's default — the harness passes
  no flag, so a clean pass is itself proof of what ships). The recorded command
  must **not** re-run: the pane shows the
  `--- previous session was lost; … ---` notice, there is **no** second `PANE=`
  marker after it, and an `echo` probe typed into the pane comes back with a
  **new pid** and a **cwd equal to the one the dead session recorded** — i.e. a
  live login shell where the session used to be. (Panes print
  `PANE=<n> PID=<pid> CWD=<pwd>` at startup precisely so this comparison has a
  baseline.)
- `--relaunch=rerun` launches the app with `--session-relaunch=rerun` and keeps
  the pre-`restore` expectations: the marker command re-ran, so a fresh `PANE=`
  marker with a new, live pid sits after the divider.

**Mouse-mode assertion (bug 2).** Each fixture pane arms what a real TUI arms —
any-event mouse tracking, SGR encoding, bracketed paste, hidden cursor — so the
ring snapshot carries those escapes and the replay re-arms them in a pane whose
consumer is dead. Mode state is invisible in `+read`, so `vt-mode-probe.py` is
typed into each restored pane to ask the emulator directly (DECRQM, `CSI ? n $ p`)
and every mouse mode must come back `reset` with the cursor visible. The panes
also `stty -echo`: with tracking armed and nothing reading stdin, the tty echoes
every pointer report back as `^[[<35;12;29M` text, which fills the live test
windows with garbage and then gets replayed into the restored pane — noise that
is indistinguishable at a glance from the bug itself.

Every probe carries a unique `--tag`. A pane is probed once per cycle, the
previous cycle's answer is still in its scrollback, and a reboot restore replays
that scrollback back in — an untagged reader parses the last cycle's pid and
calls it a pass.

Before killing the agent, the harness waits for its ring snapshots to reach disk
(`wait_rings_flushed`). The flush is triggered by the viewer disconnect the
harness just caused; SIGKILLing the agent milliseconds later races it, and the
pane that loses comes back with no pre-restart scrollback — a flake that looks
exactly like a broken replay.

**launchd respawn throttle.** launchd rate-limits `KeepAlive` respawns to once
per `ThrottleInterval` (default 10 s) since the job's last spawn. A real agent
crash happens long after startup, so before each kill the harness settles the
live agent past that floor (tracking its spawn wall-clock — this box's
`ps -o etimes=` is not a valid keyword) to measure the true single-crash latency
rather than a throttle artifact of rapid cycling.

**Cleanliness.** The debug LaunchAgent is a distinct label from the release job,
and `full_reset` boots it out (+ removes the plist) at start and teardown, so a
KeepAlive job never lingers on the machine after a run. Because launchd owns the
agent, `--agent-restart` (and any run after it) relies on that bootout — a bare
`SIGKILL` of a `KeepAlive` agent would be undone by launchd instantly.

## `session-persistence.py --reboot-tui` — reboot restore of TUI panes

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --reboot-tui [--keep] [--verbose]
```

`--agent-restart` panes run an `echo` loop; every pane a real user restores is
running Claude Code, which is what broke. This mode reproduces that case with
`tui-stream.py`, a generator of Claude-Code-shaped output measured from real ring
snapshots: synchronized-output frames redrawn in place with relative cursor
motion, queries the terminal answers (`CSI c`, `CSI ? 2026 $ p`, `CSI > 0 q`,
`CSI ? u`), kitty keyboard pushes and modifyOtherKeys, 24-bit color — several MB
per pane, many times the agent's 2 MB ring.

Three windows:

- **tuiA** — the inline renderer: 120 `CONVO-A-nnnn` conversation lines under a
  constantly redrawn prompt box. Its command `cd`s into a subdirectory first.
- **tuiB** — the full-screen renderer: `BEFORE-TUI-B` on the primary screen,
  then the alt screen + any-event mouse tracking, with the `?1049h` long gone
  from the ring window.
- **bare** — a window opened with NO working directory (a raw IPC request,
  bypassing the CLI, which would supply its own cwd).

Asserted LIVE, before any reboot: every conversation line present exactly once
and one prompt box (no lost or misplaced output under flow control), and the bare
window started in the app's default directory. Then app + agent are SIGKILLed,
launchd restarts the agent, and the app is relaunched. Asserted per pane: the
`session was lost` notice within 20 s; a live shell under it answering an echo in
< 8 s, in the right cwd (tuiA: the directory it `cd`'d to — only a live re-sample
finds it); mouse/focus/paste/2026 modes off, cursor visible, kitty keyboard flags
0 (`vt-mode-probe.py kitty`); tuiA's buffer holds all 120 lines once, in order,
plus its final prompt box and no stale frames; tuiB's holds the primary screen
AND the app's last frame and no stale frames; no query reply typed into any
restored shell. Globally: no `termio mailbox full` drops in the app log after
relaunch, and no `RESIZE rows=17 cols=49` (the pre-layout placeholder) ever
reaching the agent.

Run against the pre-fix build (1.37.0's code) it fails 14 assertions — every
symptom the user reported. The bare/cwd expectations need
`--window-inherit-working-directory=false` (passed by the mode), since an
inheriting window correctly copies the focused window's directory.

## `session-persistence.py --restore-resize` — restored output re-wraps

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --restore-resize
```

For each of app quit, app crash and reboot: a shell prints two 300-character
lines in a split (100-column) pane, the app restarts, the pane is widened (split
closed, 200 columns) and narrowed again; both lines must still read as one
300-character line each. Fails without the restore paths' `unwrap = true` (lines
frozen at the old width) or without their prompt marks (the first resize blanks
the restored output back to an older prompt). The window is 200 columns so the
pane is never narrower than a long prompt: zsh redraws a WRAPPED prompt with its
old row count and clobbers the line above, restore or no restore.

## `session-persistence.py --agent-only` — in-place recovery (task T12e)

```
scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py --agent-only [--cycles=3]
```

In-place **AC4**: the agent crashes while the GUI app **stays up**. This is the
same reboot floor as `--agent-restart` (children + ring RAM are lost, sessions
*relaunch*), but the app is **never** relaunched — recovery happens live.

1. **Setup** — same 2-window / 5-pane fixture + LaunchAgent as `--agent-restart`.
2. **Crash** — `SIGKILL` **only** the agent; the app keeps running. launchd's
   `KeepAlive` restarts the agent, which materializes each session as a
   relaunchable tombstone before accepting connections.
3. **Recover in place** — the live app's shared local-agent connection observes
   the dropped transport (the local UDS link never self-heals — the Zig FSM only
   computes backoff), re-dials the restarted agent **once** for all windows, and
   rebuilds each open window's full split tree in place → re-`ATTACH` finds the
   tombstone → auto-`RELAUNCH` with the `--- session restarted ---` banner.

Each cycle asserts the reboot-cycle checks (agent PID changed ≤ 5 s, fresh child
PIDs, restart banner, the `--relaunch` policy's own expectations, exact topology
from the manifest) **plus the defining
in-place invariant: the app process is unchanged** (it did not relaunch). The
local machine pill stays hidden throughout — recovery looks like the panes just
restarted in place. Measured recovery ~2.5–3.7 s. Same launchd-throttle settling
and LaunchAgent cleanliness as `--agent-restart` above.

Panes are identified across the rebuild by marker, then by name, then by
**position** (window + leaf order): the in-place rebuild gives split panes new
leaf names, and under `restore` a relaunched pane re-prints no marker, so a split
pane can have neither (this mode had been failing on exactly that since
`restore` became the default, with every pane in fact recovered).

The per-window remote reconnect ladder (WP-D1) is intentionally **not** used for
local windows: it re-dials the loopback machine over TCP (the local transport is
a UDS) and would collapse the window to a single root pane. Local recovery is
centralized in `LocalAgentManager` → `AppDelegate.recoverSessionLayoutInPlace`.
