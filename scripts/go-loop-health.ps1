#
# The pieces this reads all existed - go-loop-lock.ps1 status, go-loop-exec.ps1
# list, go-loop-watchdog.ps1 -Status, the dashboard port - but answering "is the
# loop actually running, and for how long" meant running four commands and
# correlating them by hand. That is too much friction for a check that is
# supposed to happen every couple of hours, and friction is why it did not
# happen: on 2026-08-11 the loop was revived into a second window at 08:21 and
# nobody noticed until the user asked why the tracker had died.
#
# Every line is timestamped and carries UPTIME, because "alive" alone cannot
# tell a loop that has run all night from one revived forty seconds ago - and
# the difference between those two is the entire question.

# It also answers "did today's digest get written?" (`digest=` on the line,
# T1223) - go.md step 0.5 had no enforcement at all, so a skipped morning was
# invisible until somebody asked for it - and "did anything actually SHIP?"
# (`publish=`, T1292), which had the same shape and cost three days of finished
# work sitting on the branch while the user ran a build from before it.
#
# And it answers the question all of those presuppose: "is the loop doing WORK?"
# (`turn_age=`, T1290). Every other clock here measures liveness - a pid, a port,
# a pane that produced output - and on 2026-09-03 the loop was inert for 14.5
# hours while this line said HEALTHY, because the watchdog's nudge had refreshed
# the transcript six minutes earlier. A nudge is a treatment, not evidence; only
# a completed turn moves `turn_started`, so only a completed turn clears this.
#
# Exit codes are the verdict, so a caller can branch without parsing:
#   0 healthy      - a live owner, recent activity, a turning loop, a marked window
#   1 degraded     - running, but something is off (no marked window, no
#                    watchdog, dashboard down, activity going stale, no turn
#                    completed inside -TurnStaleMinutes)
#   2 down         - no live loop owner at all
#   3 stopped      - quiet ON PURPOSE: somebody ran `go-loop-exec.ps1 stop`.
#                    Distinct from `down` because a supervisor that cannot tell
#                    them apart re-enters the loop the user just stopped.

# from before the fix they had asked for. "Nothing shipped" has to be visible in
# the same place as "no digest", so it is.
#
# Read from the publish watermark alone: no gh, no network, no clock beyond the
# local date. daily-publish.ps1 is what reconciles a pushed tag against the
# release CI actually created, so by the time a state gets here it is honest.

#                are on nobody's machine (T1294)

# the day HAD published, and 24 commits - including the fix for the bug the user
# had just reported - sat behind it. "Published" and "current" are different
# questions, and only the second one is the one a user feels. It is deliberately
# NOT a degrade: a commit landing after a release is the normal state of an
# afternoon, and a light that is always red is not a light. What degrades is a
# publish REQUEST that has gone unhonoured, because that is somebody asking for a
# release and not getting one.
# An `attempting` stamp older than this is a publish nobody finished (T1369).
