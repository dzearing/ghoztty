.SYNOPSIS
  Report which acceptance harnesses have not been run since the code they
  cover last changed.

.DESCRIPTION
  T783. On 2026-08-11 b64c3e8aa prefixed every scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1 message
  with an ISO timestamp. 26 assertions in test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1 anchor on
  the answer's FIRST WORD (^ACQUIRED, ^held, ^stale-dead), so the whole guard
  went red against a lock script that was working perfectly - and nobody noticed
  for a day, because that guard is not in the P1-P3 floor and nothing tied an
  edit of the loop's scripts to it. The loop's supervisor is the one thing whose
  failure nothing else can catch, so its harness going quietly red is the worst
  place in the tree for that gap.

  THE MECHANISM. A green harness run STAMPS the content of every file it covers
  (scripts\guard-due.ps1 update, called by the harness itself). This command
  compares the files on disk against that stamp:

    * every covered file hashes the same as the stamp  => the harness has been
      run against exactly this code. CURRENT, exit 0.
    * any covered file changed, appeared, or vanished  => nothing has run that
      harness against the code as it now stands. DUE, exit 1, naming the files.

  It is a CHANGE gate, not a schedule: a stamp does not go stale with time, and
  a file edited and edited back is not due. The stamp is committed, so it
  travels with the change - a `git pull` that brings in a loop-script edit made
  on another seat reads as DUE here, which is the case a purely local mtime or
  a "did this turn touch it" check cannot see.

  WHAT IT IS NOT. It never runs the harness (that would put a multi-minute
  GUI-launching acceptance script inside whatever called this), and it never
  decides that a harness PASSES - only that one has not been asked. A red
  harness run leaves the stamp alone, so red stays due.

  ADVISORY ROWS (T1189). A row may declare `Advisory = $true`, which means it
  is REPORTED everywhere a blocking row is and never counted against the
  validate gate. That is not a softer version of the same claim - it is for the
  one shape this mechanism otherwise handles badly: a question this box is
  physically unable to answer (the MSI compile needs Linux tooling and
  therefore Docker, which is deliberately kept down here), whose real
  enforcement lives elsewhere (fork-ci compiles the package on every push and
  `validate` fails on a red CI verdict). Before it, that row was due after every
  packaging edit and the only way past the gate was `-NoGuardDue` on every
  commit; a hatch pressed every time stops being a signal, and it hid the case
  the hatch exists for. An advisory row still says `GUARD DUE (advisory)` until
  it is cleared, so nothing goes quiet.

  CLEARED FROM CI (T1189). A row may declare `CiEvidence` - a workflow and a
  job whose green run over a commit proves what the harness would have proved
  locally. `stamp-ci` finds a successful run of that job, checks that every
  covered file AT THAT RUN'S COMMIT hashes the same as the file on disk now, and
  only then writes the stamp (recording the run url and sha as its provenance).
  A stamp written from a run whose tree differed would be the exact lie this
  whole mechanism exists to prevent, so the content check is not optional and
  there is no hatch past it.

  WIRED INTO (both deliberately different in force):
    * scripts\go-loop-exec.ps1 claim - go.md step 0, every turn. Reports, never
      fails: a claim that can exit nonzero over a stale stamp would wedge the
      loop, which is the disease, not the cure.
    * scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 validate - go.md step 6, before every commit.
      FAILS, because that is the gate with teeth, and the remedy (run the
      harness, or fix what it caught) is the work this exists to cause.

  Acceptance: test\win32\guard-due.ps1.

# The coverage table. One row per harness; adding a row is the whole cost of
# closing this gap for the next harness that grows one.
#
# `Covers` are repo-relative globs. Keep a row to the family the harness is
# ABOUT: a gate that demands a go-loop run every time a shared library moves is
# noise, and noise is how a gate gets ignored. scripts\lib\NativeArgv.ps1 is
# reached transitively from here and is deliberately NOT covered - it has its
# own acceptance (test\win32\cli-argv-fidelity.ps1), which is the same argument
# in the other direction.
#
# Every pattern here must MATCH SOMETHING in this repo (T1227). One that does
# not is not an error you will see: it contributes no files and the row goes on
# reporting CURRENT over the ones that are left, so the guard quietly watches
# less code than it claims to. `check` audits the table for that before it
# reports any verdict; move a file and its entry moves with it.

    # months - could not be proved here at all. The harness itself is
    # deliberately NOT covered by either row: it is the wiring row's subject,
    # and an edit to a static assertion must not put these rows out of reach.
    #
    # ADVISORY since T1189, and that word is doing real work. The question this
    # row asks - does the package still COMPILE? - cannot be answered on this
    # box at all: wixl is Linux tooling, Docker is deliberately kept down here
    # (a WSL2 backend that has buried the machine before), and starting it is
    # the user's call. So the row was due after every build-msi.sh edit and the
    # only way past the pre-commit gate was `validate -NoGuardDue` - an override
    # pressed every time, which is indistinguishable from the misuse that hatch
    # exists to make visible. A blocking gate with only one possible answer is
    # not a gate.
    #
    # What still holds build-msi.sh to account, so this is a de-escalation and
    # not a hole:
    #   * the `install-launch` row below covers the same file and IS blocking -
    #     it is cleared by a Docker-less run, so a build-msi.sh edit still has
    #     to produce evidence before it can be committed;
    #   * sections B5-B7 of this same harness parse the generated WXS without
    #     Docker, which is T1218's whole defect class;
    #   * fork-ci's `windows-cross` job COMPILES the MSI on every push, and
    #     `parity-tasks.ps1 validate` already FAILS on a red CI verdict (T1219),
    #     so the compile is enforced by the machine that can actually answer it,
    #     one turn later, rather than by a stamp nothing here can write.
    #
    # This row is what reports whether that answer has been READ: printed by
    # every claim, never counted against validate, and cleared either by a local
    # Docker run (exactly as before) or from the green CI run that proved it -

    # so an RDP connection from anywhere - localhost included - disconnects the
    # console rather than joining it; getting a remote session takes a second
    # machine and a person on it. Unlike `release-artifacts-packaging` there is

    # `build-msi.sh` the question is unanswerable here, which is exactly the
    # shape a hatch pressed every time cannot carry. It reports at every claim,
    # the daily publish gives it a package carrying the change within a day, and
    # its teeth in the meantime are fork-ci's `windows-cross` compile of the same
    # file. A clean walk with no skipped case stamps it the normal way.

      moves on. A whole row that matches nothing is reported (`GUARD N/A`), but a
      row with one good pattern and one broken one is not - it looks CURRENT
      while quietly watching one file fewer than it claims. That is a check that
      cannot fire, which go.md says a gate must never be.

      Two faults, and they answer different questions:

        * control-char - a path carrying a byte below 0x20. Always checked, in
          any tree: no file can have such a name, so the entry is a typo
          wherever it is read. This is the shape a shell heredoc leaves behind
          when it halves a backslash (`\a` -> 0x07, `\b` -> 0x08).

        * matches-nothing - a pattern that matches no file while ANOTHER pattern
          in the same row does. The sibling is what makes it a typo rather than
          a foreign tree, and it is why this needs no allow-list: a row that is
          wholly inapplicable stays silent.

  T1325. A row may also watch files that live in ANOTHER tree - `Upstream` is a
  list of paths inside `origin/main`, and their blob shas go into the stamp
  beside the covered files' hashes.

  Why a row would want that: `hook-json` asserts that the vendored asset mirror
  is byte-identical to tip-of-main, and NOTHING in our tree changes when main
  advances. So the mirror went stale on 2026-09-02, the harness would have said
  so, and the guard never reopened to ask it - the T1099 shape, a verdict that
  can only ever say "fine" until something unrelated pokes it. Keying on the
  upstream BLOB rather than on main's head sha means ordinary main churn is
  silent and a change to a file we actually mirror is not.

  An answer is only possible where `origin/main` exists; a clone without it (a
  fixture repo, a fresh worktree with no fetch) gets $null, and $null means
  "cannot answer", never "changed" - so the gate can no more go red for missing
  a remote than it can for missing the files it covers.

      changes no verdict - it exists because the provenance line did not say
      so. On 2026-08-23 a green run at 01:59 stamped the working tree that was
      committed seven minutes later as 9d445b377, and the line therefore read
      `stamped 2026-08-23 from 820193367` - a commit that predated the change.
      A turn read that as proof the gate had let a changed file through and
      opened a question about the gate; the gate was right and the sentence was
      not. `from <sha> +N uncommitted` cannot be read that way.

          <job> concluded success over a commit whose covered files are byte for
          byte the ones on disk now" - and every part of it is checked:

            * the run's workflow name matches the row's CiEvidence,
            * the run completed with conclusion `success`,
            * the NAMED JOB inside it concluded success (a run can be green with
              the job that matters skipped, which proves nothing),
            * every covered file at that run's commit hashes the same as the
              working tree, through this script's own normalisation.
