# Upgrade a DEV install of Ghoztty in place and resume work.
#
# T1218 / decision D85 (2026-08-31) - READ THIS FIRST. This script used to own
# the user's installed terminal: it swapped `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ghoztty`
# out of a repo build every morning. It does not any more, and it refuses to.
# The installed app is the product, only the in-app updater may replace it, and
# only with a published release ("the terminal should only ever run something
# that was actually published"). What survives here is the DEV path: the same
# kill/swap/verify/resume machinery pointed at an install the loop owns
# (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\dev-install` by default). The rule and the refusal
# both live in scripts\install-ownership.ps1; the way to get today's work to the
# user is scripts\publish-windows-release.ps1.
#
# Designed to be launched DETACHED from a Claude Code session running inside
# the very Ghoztty instance being upgraded (nothing in that process tree can
# do the swap while its own GUI is being killed). Launch it in its own console
# and end the turn:
#
#   Start-Process powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -ArgumentList `
#     '-NoProfile','-ExecutionPolicy','Bypass','-File',
#     'D:\git\ghoztty\scripts\upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1'
#
# Sequence: verify the staged bits ARE the delivery -> wait -> kill release
# ghoztty processes (install dir only; debug zig-out instances untouched) ->
# swap exe + share\ from the staging prefix -> verify the installed exe reports
# the delivered commit -> mirror to the other install locations -> RESUME the
# loop. Every step is appended to %TEMP%\ghoztty-upgrade.log so the resumed
# session can verify what happened.
#
# T208 - this script deliberately does NOT build; it copies whatever is in
# $Staging. That is why both ends are verified against a commit: on 2026-07-30 a
# delivery copied the PREVIOUS delivery's binary and `exe swapped` + `UPGRADE OK`
# both reported success over it. `UPGRADE OK` now means "the installed exe
# answers with the commit this delivery was for", and a stale staging prefix
# skips the swap entirely rather than shipping it.
#
# T138 - the resume is a decision, not a fixed action. This script was written
# against the pre-session-persistence world, where "killing ghoztty.exe kills
# the session's shell and Claude with it" and so a relaunch was always right.
# Since T89 the agent owns the PTY and is deliberately never killed: the Claude
# session SURVIVES the upgrade and the relaunched app re-attaches its pane. So
# an unconditional `+new-window --command="claude --continue ..."` produced a
# SECOND session on the same transcript, and both sessions picked the same task
# (user-hit 2026-07-28). Now the script stamps the launching Claude BEFORE the
# kill and checks afterwards:
#   survived -> type the prompt into its existing pane (no second session)
#   gone     -> relaunch a window with the resume command, as before
#   -NoResume + a killed app -> restart the app, type nothing (T531: -NoResume
#   suppresses the resume TYPING only; the terminal always comes back)
#
# T200 - the launch itself is a compatibility boundary. `Start-Process
# -ArgumentList @(...)` does NOT quote its elements: they are joined with spaces
# and re-tokenized by this script's own parser, so a multi-word -ResumePrompt is
# shredded into positional arguments. Measured 2026-07-30: a prompt containing a
# bare `-` died in parameter BINDING (before line 1, so nothing could be logged,
# and a detached hidden child discards stderr - the delivery vanished with zero
# evidence); with the hyphen removed the same prompt bound prose to three
# parameters at once ($Staging='Verify', $ResumeCommand='It', $LoopPaneId='did').
# Hence: PositionalBinding=$false so a stray word is a loud error instead of a
# silent mis-bind, -ResumePromptFile so free text never travels through argv at
# all, and scripts/launch-upgrade.ps1 which refuses to believe the launch worked
# until this script's first log line appears.
#
# PositionalBinding=$false, not a bare [CmdletBinding()]: every [string] param
# here is positional by default, so plain CmdletBinding still let the shrapnel
# land - measured, `-Staging x -NoResume aStrayWord` bound aStrayWord to
# $InstallDir and ran. Nothing about this script should ever be passed by
# position.
