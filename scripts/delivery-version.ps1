# The delivery's BUILD and FRESHNESS helpers (tracker T208).
#
# `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` has no build step by design - it copies whatever
# is already sitting in `zig-out-release`. That contract was written down
# nowhere the caller reads, so on 2026-07-30 a delivery of T202 shipped the
# PREVIOUS delivery's binary while `LAUNCH OK`, `exe swapped` and `UPGRADE OK`
# all reported success. `ghoztty +version` afterwards still said `+9968a62d9`.
#
# The answer is a number both sides can compare: the short commit baked into the
# exe by `src/build/GitVersion.zig` (semver build metadata, so it appears after
# the last `+`) against `git rev-parse --short HEAD`. This module owns reading
# both and comparing them, so the launcher's pre-flight, the upgrade script's
# pre-swap abort and its post-swap verification cannot drift apart.
#
# Three traps are handled here once:
#
#   * ghoztty.exe is a GUI-subsystem binary, so `& $exe +version > file` from
#     PowerShell writes ZERO bytes, silently (T245). Every probe below runs
#     through `cmd.exe /c ... > file`, which is the shape that works and is
#     already how `Invoke-GhozttyListJson` reads `+list`.
#   * a probe with no timeout can block forever on a half-open pipe (T187), so
#     the child is waited on with a hard deadline and killed past it.
#   * `+version` answers for TWO binaries, not one (T773). Below its own
#     `Version` block it prints a `Running Instance` block describing whatever
#     Ghoztty is RUNNING, fetched over IPC (`src/cli/version.zig`
#     printRunningInstance, added by T52) - and that block is the only one with
#     a line literally labelled `commit`. A reader who greps for the commit gets
#     the running app's, which is a different binary that a delivery is not
#     shipping. On 2026-08-11 that misread was filed as a P1 "the build bakes a
#     stale commit stamp": a Debug build and a ReleaseFast build both "reported"
#     the same 12-hours-old sha because both had dialed the same installed
#     release. The bake was correct the whole time. See `Get-CommitFromVersionText`.

# The short hash out of a `+version` payload. Pure: no process, no filesystem.
#
# Anchors on the `- version:` line rather than scanning the whole document,
# because the Build Config section below it is free text and a future line there
# could easily contain something `+hex`-shaped. Falls back to the banner line.
#
# That anchor is also what keeps the `Running Instance` block out (T773): its own
# version line is `  - version : <v>` - one space before the colon - so the
# literal `version:` here cannot match it, and its `  - commit  : <sha>` line is
# never looked at. The distinction between "the binary I am shipping" and "the
# app that happens to be running" therefore rests on a single space, which is
# exactly the kind of thing a formatting tidy erases: arms A31-A35 of
# `test\win32\upgrade-staleness.ps1` hold it with a payload whose two sections

# The newest PUBLISHED Windows release version, from the repo's `win-v*` tags
# (T1217). '' when there is no such tag or git is unavailable.
#
# Why the loop's own delivery needs this: a script-built staging exe carries the
# repo's `build.zig.zon` version (1.4.0), and that exe is delivered OVER the
# user's installed release. The MSI pipeline stamps a real semver
# (`-Dversion-string=<semver>+<hash>`); the script path did not, so the user's
# terminal reported 1.4.0 and - once the update check became location-aware -
# would have compared 1.4.0 against `win-v1.35.0` and offered a DOWNGRADE.
# Stamping the newest published version keeps the delivered build "up to date"
# against what is on the site, and it takes the NEXT release the moment one is
# published. The `+<hash>` half stays HEAD's, so the staleness gate above still
# reads the commit these bytes were built from.
#
# Ordering is by semver, not by tag creation date or string sort: `win-v1.9.0`
# must not outrank `win-v1.10.0`.
# The pure half: pick the newest X.Y.Z out of a list of tag names. '' when the
# list holds no `win-v<X.Y.Z>` tag at all. Anything else in the list - a `v*`
# release tag, `win-v1.4.1-rc1`, a branch name that wandered in - is ignored
# rather than guessed at.
