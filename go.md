# go.md — on-box (Windows) session entry point

You are the on-box Windows session for the Windows parity effort.

## THE TURN (user, 2026-07-28 — this is the whole job, every time)

> pick up a task, build it, test it, make sure it's right, assess if more
> tasks need to be done, update the task doc with status and new tasks, then
> `/reset-context` to start over

Concretely, in order, with no stops in between:

0. **Claim the loop** (T139) — one command, before anything else:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-exec.ps1 claim
   ```

   - Exit **0** (`PRIMARY …`): you are the execution window. Carry on.
   - Exit **3** (`STAND-DOWN …`): another session already holds the loop.
     This window has been unmarked and closed; **stop, do not pick a task.**
   - Exit **4** (`STOPPED by request …`): the user asked the queue to drain
     (`go-loop-exec.ps1 stop`). **Stop, do not pick a task, and do not
     `/reset-context`** — perpetuating the loop is the one thing that defeats
     the request. Report what the last turn finished and that the loop is
     parked; the window has already unmarked itself and given up the lock. This
     is not a failure: it is quiet on purpose, and nothing needs diagnosing.
     Only the user resumes it, with
     `powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-exec.ps1 resume` — which since
     T1478 **restarts the parked session** as well as clearing the flag, and is
     judged on the loop reaching `held`. Clearing the flag alone used to say
     "claim will take the loop again on the next turn", a future that cannot
     arrive: the parked session is idle at its composer and nothing re-triggers
     it. A resume that does not bring the loop back now exits 5 and says
     `RESUME INCOMPLETE` with the remedy, instead of the 2026-09-09 exit 0 over
     a loop that stayed down for seven minutes.
   - What it does: takes the lock (`scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1`), pins this
     window's title to `[go-loop] …` so the execution window is identifiable
     on sight and in `+list --json`, then resolves duplicates **without
     asking anyone** — it messages the other window's session to say it is a
     duplicate, closes it, and continues.
   - **Only `[go-loop]`-marked windows are ever touched.** A second Claude
     window that is filing tasks, auditing, or reviewing is unmarked, so it is
     never a rival and never gets closed. That is the normal case on this box.
   - **It also reports STRANDED WORK** (T847): anything dirty in the tree at
     claim time is a dead turn's work, since this turn has not touched a file
     yet — the CLAUDE.md split sat uncommitted for two days because nothing at
     any boundary was obliged to notice. The claim snapshots those paths, and
     step 6's `validate` FAILS while they stay dirty: fold them into their own
     commit, revert them, or file a task for them and run
     `parity-tasks.ps1 ack-stranded <Tid>` (the ack holds while that task is
     open, so the gate cannot wedge the loop). Never sweep them silently into
     your task's commit, and never keep working past the report as if the tree
     were clean.
   - **It also reports the CI VERDICT** (T1219): every push this loop makes
     starts a build, and until this line nothing in the turn ever read the
     answer — fork-ci sat red for ten hours on 2026-08-31 with the exact
     failure that later killed the win-v1.36.0 release run. The claim names
     what the build machine concluded about the commit this branch is sitting
     on (`CI RED` names the workflow, the failing job and the run url), and
     step 6's `validate` FAILS on a red one. An **in-progress run is not a
     failure** — this turn's own push is still building at that point — and
     neither is `CI UNKNOWN` (no run yet, no `gh`, no network). The
     `-NoCiCheck` hatch is for a run that is red for a reason that is not this
     turn's, and it prints that it was used. Ask directly with
     `scripts\ci-status.ps1 check`; acceptance is section E of
     `test\win32\gate-negatives.ps1`.
   - **It also reports a BOOT OUTAGE** (T829): after a restart with nobody at
     the keyboard, no process of ours can run at all — Windows creates no
     session, so both the Run entry and the supervisor's scheduled task are
     skipped, and one such reboot cost 25 hours. Nothing can send a signal
     *during* that window, so the claim sends it on the way back: it measures
     power-on against the moment a desktop actually existed and prints the gap
     once per reboot. A quiet claim means the box signed itself back in. The
     block names the one-time Windows sign-in setting that closes it — that
     link is the user's to flip and nothing here will do it for them. Full
     audit: `scripts\go-loop-boot.ps1 check`; `install` re-registers the revive
     task with its AT LOGON trigger and without the battery gate and 72-hour
     limit that Task Scheduler defaults to.
   - The arbiter is the lock, not a negotiation: whoever holds it is primary,
     which is symmetric and cannot deadlock. Ownership is keyed on the
     **pane**, so a relaunched claude in the same pane is the same slot (the
     upgrade script does exactly that). A lock whose owner died — or whose
     heartbeat is older than 30 min — is taken over automatically, so a crash
     never wedges the loop.
   - `scripts\go-loop-exec.ps1 list` shows every window and which are marked.

0.5. **Daily digest** (user, 2026-08-05) — before picking a task, check
   `docs/design/windows-parity-digests/<today>.md` (local date). If it is
   **5am or later** and today's file does not exist, write it now; then carry
   on with the turn. Rules:

   - **The check that says whether you owe one** (T1223) is the `digest=`
     field on `scripts\go-loop-health.ps1`: `present`, `missing` (past 05:00,
     the loop turned today, no file — and the run reads DEGRADED), or
     `not-due`. It never writes one, because a generated digest would turn the
     light green and destroy the only thing the light measures. Before this
     the step had no enforcement at all: the 2026-09-01 miss surfaced because
     the user asked for it, and 08-24 → 08-29 surfaced never.
   - **One file per day, today only — never backfill.** If the loop was down
     for three days, the next turn writes today's digest and nobody writes the
     missing two: a digest is a morning read, not a ledger, and a backfilled
     reflection is fiction.
   - It renders in the dashboard's **Daily digest** view (markdown: headings,
     lists, bold, links). Frontmatter: just `date: "YYYY-MM-DD"`. The view
     renders its own day/date header, so the body starts at the categories.
   - **The body has two CATEGORIES, each an H2, rendered as tabs** (user,
     2026-08-06): `## Commentary` (this step writes it) and `## Task triage`
     (step 0.6 writes it). Subsections inside a category are H3s.
   - **Audience: the user, over coffee.** Plain language, no task-id soup —
     name a task id only when they might click it. `## Commentary` covers:
     - **Yesterday** — what actually landed (from the log and the tracker's
       activity), and what it means for the end goal, not a commit list.
       **Name what SHIPPED**, not only what landed (T1220): the release the
       end-of-day publish created, and whether it carries the work described
       here — read it from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\daily-publish` (date, tag,
       commit, outcome) or `gh release list --repo dzearing/ghoztty`. If nothing
       was published, say so and why (a skip names its reason in
       `%TEMP%\ghoztty-daily-publish.log`), because the morning question this
       tab answers is "is what I am running the work I read about yesterday?".

       **And name what is STRANDED** (T1294): the commits that landed after that
       release and are therefore on nobody's machine. One command answers both
       halves —

       ```
       powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\daily-publish.ps1 -Status
       ```

       — and a stranded list holding a fix somebody is waiting on is exactly what
       this tab exists to surface. The remedy is a request, per step 6.5.
     - **Today's focus** — what the queue says comes next and why that is the
       right next thing.
     - **Reflection** — a genuine step back: how the work has been going,
       common themes across recent tasks and decisions, what keeps recurring.
       Are tools missing? Skills missing? Is the UX clean? Which gaps still
       stand between here and the **cutover to `main`**? Think out of the
       box; propose process changes, not just code changes.
     - **Decisions** — anything filed for the user's call, and any directives
       from recently resolved ones that should steer the day.
   - Write it from evidence (the log, `git log` since yesterday 5am, the
     dashboard payload, resolved decisions), not from memory of the session.

0.6. **Daily triage** (user, 2026-08-06; option A of the convergence
   decision) — runs whenever step 0.5 wrote a new digest, immediately after
   it. Purpose: the backlog CONVERGES only if intake is controlled and the
   completion number has a fixed denominator. Mechanics:

   - **Milestone cutline.** `milestone: "M1"` in a task's frontmatter marks
     it part of the current convergence target; the dashboard's number is
     M1-closed / M1-total, never done/all-time. **New tasks default OUT of
     M1** — promotion is a deliberate triage act, with the same bar as a P0/
     P1 call: user-facing, or blocking a user-facing task, or blocking the
     cutover goal (this branch -> `main`). Never remove a task from M1 to make
     the number move —
     scope-cuts are `skipped(reason)`, visible as closures, not silent
     demotions.
   - **Sweep new-since-yesterday tasks** (git: task files added since the
     last triage): confirm each has a sane `priority:` + `triage-reason:`,
     wire `deps:` both ways (a follow-up depends on its parent; a split's
     children carry the parent's deps), and make the M1 in/out call.
   - **Dependency hygiene, whole backlog**: deps naming a missing id, deps
     already satisfied (parent done/skipped), and cycles. `order:` is
     re-derived where it contradicts deps — a dependent never sorts before
     what it waits on. (Do not hand-renumber the world; fix contradictions.)
   - **Staleness sweep**: open todos untouched for 30+ days, or whose
     subject a later task/fix superseded, become PROPOSED closes — listed in
     the triage summary with a one-line reason each. A proposal the user has
     not vetoed by the NEXT day's triage is closed as `skipped(stale: …)`.
     Never close a P0/P1 by staleness alone.
   - **Already-fixed sweep** (T404): run
     `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 stale-scan -Top 20` and check the `named=` rows —
     open todos a LATER commit named by id, which is the shape of a card
     something else already fixed in passing. Verify before closing; the report
     is a prompt, not a verdict. Anything closed this way names the commit that
     actually fixed it and lands the validation the card was owed.
   - **Main intake** (user, 2026-08-07: "reduce the lag of the windows
     client to virtually hours rather than days"; daily for now): `git fetch
     origin main`, then evaluate every commit new since the last intake and
     BREAK THE INCOMING CHANGES INTO TASKS for the windows seat — one task
     per coherent change (feature, fix, behavior change), priority by user
     impact, `milestone: "M1"` when it is user-facing parity, dep-linked to
     each other where the upstream commits build on each other. Watermark:
     `docs/design/windows-parity-main-intake.json` holds the last evaluated
     main sha (`{ "lastEvaluated": "<sha>", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`) —
     update it in the same commit as the filed tasks, so intake never
     double-files and never skips. Pure refactors with no windows-visible
     behavior can be batched into one task; note what was batched. The goal
     is that main's changes are IN THE QUEUE within a day of landing, and
     the lag is worked off task by task instead of accumulating into a
     merge cliff.

     **Gate the intake on the sweep, not on your reading of it** (T152).
     After filing, run

     ```
     powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-sweep.ps1
     ```

     which enumerates every non-merge commit in
     `<lastEvaluated>..origin/main` touching `macos/` or **`src/`** (minus the
     two frontends that owe Windows nothing — `src/apprt/win32/` is ours,
     `src/apprt/gtk/` is Linux's) and reports the ones no Windows task, log
     entry, digest or decision has ever cited. The shared core is in the watch
     list since **T685**: a parity obligation arrives through it as often as
     through `macos/` (T604 exists because main rewrote `src/cli/send_keys.zig`
     underneath this branch and nothing flagged it), and subtracting from
     `src/` rather than listing subtrees means a directory main adds next month
     is watched by default. Widening it puts OUR work in scope too, so only the
     **incoming side** is enumerated — a commit in the range that is not
     reachable from `-IncomingRef` (`origin/main`, else `main`) is branch-local,
     dropped, and counted separately in the report. That is a no-op for the
     daily intake range and the difference between a usable report and 187
     lines of our own history for `-Range <merge-base>..HEAD`.
     **Exit 1 means unmapped commits — file a task for each (or cite
     it as no-parity-owed in the intake note) and re-run until it exits 0**;
     only then move the watermark. This exists because the sweeps before it
     (T88, T117) recorded a *narrative* of what a merge contained, and a
     narrative cannot be checked for holes: 16 Mac commits were merged and
     never mapped to any work item, which is how a Mac feature silently never
     arrives here. `-Format markdown` emits the `## Parity coverage` block —
     paste it into the intake note so the enumeration is the evidence rather
     than prose about it. Acceptance: `test\win32\parity-sweep.ps1`.
   - **Write `## Task triage`** into today's digest: counts (filed
     yesterday, closed yesterday, net flow, M1 closed/total), **main intake
     (N commits evaluated, M tasks filed, current lag in commits)**, what
     was promoted into M1 and why, dep repairs made, proposed closes
     awaiting veto, and yesterday's proposals now enacted. **Scannable, never dense**
     (user, 2026-08-06): lead with an H3 stat line (`### M1: X of Y
     closed`), then short bold-labeled bullets — one idea each, two
     sentences max. No wall-of-prose paragraphs; this is read on a
     dashboard at a glance.
   - Commit triage-only frontmatter churn as `chore(triage): …` — the
     modified-date column must not read a bulk re-triage as work on 200
     tasks.

0.7. **Daily feature ideas** (user, 2026-08-09) — runs with steps 0.5/0.6,
   writing a third digest category, `## Feature ideas` (rendered as its own
   tab). This is product imagination time, not backlog grooming:

   - **Customer-facing only, UX first.** Ideas are things a USER of the
     terminal would feel and thank you for — never internal plumbing dressed
     up as a feature, and never tied to app-centric machinery. Group them:
     user-facing UX improvements FIRST, then technical / performance /
     stability / refactoring increasingly as it makes sense (soft ordering,
     not a quota — a great perf idea beats a weak UX one only rarely).
   - **Graded and sorted by user value.** Each idea: a bold name, a value
     grade (High / Medium — skip filing Low, think of better ones instead),
     and 1-2 sentences on what the user gets. Sort best-first within each
     group.
   - **Fresh every day — the ledger is the memory.** Before writing, read
     `docs/design/windows-parity-feature-ideas.md` (every idea ever
     suggested, dated). Do NOT re-suggest anything on it; an old idea may
     return only with a materially new angle, marked as such. After
     writing, append today's ideas to the ledger in the same commit. The
     point of the tab is that each morning's read is NEW thinking.
   - **5-8 ideas a day** is the shape — enough to be worth the tab, few
     enough that each one got thought. Inspiration sources: what the user
     struggled with this week (the reports), what other terminals and tools
     do well, what the digest's own Reflection keeps circling, what main
     shipped that suggests a next step.
   - An idea the user likes becomes a TASK (filed normally, named in the
     next digest); the tab itself is never a queue and carries no ids until
     promotion.

1. **Pick up a task — ONE command, which also claims it:**

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 next -Claim
   ```

   Never ask which one. `-Claim` marks the task it hands you `in-progress` in
   the same breath, and that mark is the ONLY thing that says what is being
   worked right now: the loop lock records the pane, the turn and a heartbeat
   but NOT the task. This used to be two commands — `next`, then a separate
   `set-status` — and a turn that ran the first and forgot the second left a
   watching human with a dashboard that could see the loop was alive and still
   could not name what it was doing (user, 2026-08-04: *"why is the loop status
   not getting updated"*). Picking and claiming are one act; they are now one
   command, which is the only version that cannot be half-done.

   **If it answers `RESUME:` instead of `NEXT:`, that IS your task** (user,
   2026-08-05). One agent runs this queue at a time, so a task still
   in-progress when a turn starts is a stale claim — the turn that made it
   died (crash, reboot, reset) or forgot to close out. Two bluescreens on
   2026-08-05 left T496/T497 exactly there: in-progress with no agent, half
   the fix uncommitted in the tree, and nothing telling the next turn. On a
   RESUME, **reassess before you build**: read the task's `## Progress log`,
   run `git status`/`git diff` on the files its Where section names, and
   decide from evidence whether to keep-and-finish the uncommitted work or
   reset it and restart clean. If the task should NOT be resumed (superseded,
   wrong approach), record why with `note` and set it back to `todo` — never
   just take fresh work over the top of a stale claim.

   **Journal as you work.** `next -Claim` writes the first `## Progress log`
   entry for you; add one at each meaningful step:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 note T144 -Text "root cause: X; fix going into Y" -Session <your-session-id>
   ```

   At minimum: after the root cause / design is settled, after the build,
   after validation, and whenever something surprising changes the plan
   (include ids of any tasks you filed). This is not ceremony — the progress
   log is what the RESUME path reads when a turn dies mid-task, and
   `validate` fails an in-progress task that has none. Pass `-Session` with
   your session id when you know it, so a stale task names the conversation
   that was working it.

   **Check the task is still TRUE before you build it** (T404). A todo is a
   claim about the code made on the day it was filed, and until now nothing
   re-checked it: T98 was handed out fourteen days after T41 had already fixed
   its defect at the source, and that turn produced no code. So `next` now
   prints the filing date and any commits that have touched the files the task
   itself names since, and says `CHECK FIRST` when there are any. It is a
   prompt, not a verdict — verify against the code, then take one of three
   paths: **already fixed** → close it with the commit that ACTUALLY fixed it
   (not a new one) and land the validation it was owed, since on that shape the
   *test* is the deliverable; **partly fixed** → rewrite its Summary to what is
   LEFT before you build, so you are not implementing over a fix you never
   read; **still real** → journal the re-verification and carry on.

   `stale-scan` asks the same question of the whole queue, ranked by a later
   commit having NAMED the task, then oldest first:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 stale-scan -Top 40
   ```

   **Tag it when you file it.** `new -Tags fix,polish` (closed set: `feature`
   / `fix` / `polish` / `perf` / `test` / `infra` / `docs` / `security`) —
   tags are how the dashboard tells user-facing work from internal work at a
   glance. When you claim an untagged task, tag it as part of making it
   readable — `set-tags <id> -Tags fix,polish` (T503), which validates against
   the same closed set and takes `-Add` to union with what is already there.
   Every open task carries one as of T503, so in practice this is for a
   category you realise is missing rather than a blank field.

   **And say so when a USER reported it** (T1315): `new -UserReport` writes
   `user-report: true`, and that flag is what makes closing the task ask for the
   release that carries the fix — see step 6.5. A task filed from anything the
   user said (a report in the terminal, a screenshot, "it did it again") gets
   the flag; `set-priority <id> -UserReport` adds it to one already filed.

   `next` picks by **`priority:`** (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → untriaged), then
   `order:` within that band, then id (D55; user, 2026-08-12). Priority is what
   the work is WORTH and it decides; `order:` only sequences tasks that are
   worth the same.

   **`next` IS the ordering authority, as of 2026-08-21 (T345).** There is no
   hand-curated list above it any more: every task named in **Current
   priorities** in `windows-parity-tasks.md` is closed, and that section is now
   frozen history like the state table beside it. What replaces it is
   re-triage — `set-priority` moves a task to the head of the queue on its own
   and journals why — so the queue is a pure function of the task files and no
   turn negotiates with itself about what to work on.

   **P3 means "reviewed, and deliberately behind everything else"** (T345).
   Leaving `priority:` blank does NOT say that: blank means *nobody has looked*,
   which is why untriaged sorts behind even P3. `order:` cannot say it either —
   an unplaced task ranks last within its band, so any number you write pulls
   the task *ahead* of every unordered one. A value outside the set is a
   `validate` failure, not a silent demotion to untriaged.

   It used to be the other way round, and the inversion was invisible: an
   unplaced task ranks last, so a P0 with no `order:` sorted behind every
   positioned P2 on the board. On 2026-08-11 that left three P0s the user had
   reported by hand sitting `todo` for a full day while twenty-four P2
   test-harness tasks closed in front of them.

   The consequence to rely on: **a task filed with a priority is queued
   correctly the moment it is filed** — no renumbering, no hand-placement. Give
   `order:` only when the sequence *within* a band matters (this P0 before that
   one), and use `set-order` to inject between two neighbours.

   **Re-triage is how you change what comes next.** `set-priority <id>
   -Priority P0 -Summary "<why>"` moves a task to the head of the queue on its
   own, and journals the transition (old → new, plus the reason) into the
   task's `## Progress log` — since D55 a re-prioritisation *is* a queue edit,
   so it is no longer a silent one. `-NoNote` is for a bulk normalisation pass
   and nothing else. Acceptance: sections K, K2 and K3 of
   `test\win32\parity-tasks-seat.ps1` — K3 is the loop's own shape, a low old
   id against a high follow-up id, plus the P3 band and the validate failure.

   `next` answers for **this box's seat** (T344): tasks marked `seat: mac` — a
   Swift fix, a macOS regression run — are the Mac seat's and are listed as
   skipped rather than handed to you. Do not take one; if you find a task you
   cannot validate here, mark it `seat: mac` and re-run `next`.

   Step 6 moves it to `done`; if you abandon it instead, set it back to `todo`
   rather than leaving it in progress. A task left in-progress whose file then
   goes untouched shows as **stale** on the dashboard and gets offered up for
   reset, which is the cleanup path for exactly this mistake.

   **Then make it readable.** Add these two sections to the task file if they
   are not already there — they are what a human watching the dashboard sees
   while you work:

   ```markdown
   ## In plain terms

   Two or three sentences, no jargon: what is wrong or missing right now,
   what will be different when this lands, and who notices. Name the symptom
   a user would describe, not the mechanism.

   ## Goals

   - [ ] the first concrete outcome
   - [ ] the second
   - [x] tick them off as they land
   ```

   A task title is a defect sentence written for whoever will fix it — "the
   session-interrupted notice never survives the ConPTY repaint" is precise
   and tells a watching human nothing. `## In plain terms` is the version
   they can read: no ConPTY, no repaint, no task ids. Write it for someone
   who has never opened this repo. Tick the goals as you go, so the card
   shows progress rather than a frozen list.

   **And give it validation criteria.** Every task carries a `## Validation
   criteria` checklist (`new` scaffolds it; add one to older files when you
   claim them): the observable checks that prove the task is done. Step 4
   ticks them — each tick names HOW it was verified (which script, which
   lane, which manual check). The dashboard's task detail view renders this
   checklist, so "what was validated" is answerable without the diff.
2. **Build it.**
3. **Test it** — the task's own Validation, plus the standing floor (both
   `zig build test` lanes, `zig build test-agent`, the `lib` compile, P1–P3).
   Run the four zig lanes through `scripts\floor-lane.ps1 -Lane all` (T430)
   rather than bare.

   The fourth lane, `lib`, is a **build** rather than a test, and it is the
   only thing on this box that compiles the shared core — and the libghostty
   C API the Mac seat lives on — for a Windows target (T323/T475). Two whole
   classes of breakage were invisible without it: POSIX-only code in `src/`,
   and a C API edit made from this seat that the Mac seat discovers at its
   next build. It costs about a second cached. A note on why the test lanes
   cannot cover the first one: the tests that reach POSIX-only code open with
   `if (builtin.os.tag == .windows) return error.SkipZigTest;`, and a
   comptime-known `return` stops Zig analyzing the rest of the body, so the
   lane never looks at the code it appears to cover.

   The wrapper's own reason for existing: a
   bare lane can wedge with no output and no timeout, and a wedge you cannot
   tell from a slow run is worse than a red test. The wrapper watches CPU as
   well as the clock, so it always ends with `PASS`, `FAIL` or `STALL` plus a
   diagnostic. **Run the lanes and the acceptance scripts sequentially, never
   overlapped** (T401): an acceptance script deliberately kills agents and
   takes the per-user pipe, and box load from a concurrent lane starved test
   waits badly enough to wedge the lane for 11+ minutes before T346/T258
   bounded them — today the same overlap costs a red flake that reads as
   "test-agent is flaky again". A background lane plus a foreground script is
   the exact shape that burned the T96 turn.

   **And run the harness the code you touched already has, not only the floor**
   (T783). `scripts\guard-due.ps1 check` answers "has anybody run acceptance
   harness X against the code as it now stands?" — from a stamp that a clean
   green run of that harness writes and commits, so the question survives a
   `git pull` that brings in somebody else's edit. Step 0's `claim` prints the
   answer every turn and step 6's `validate` FAILS on it, because the go-loop
   guard sat 26-red for a day with nobody the wiser: it is not in the P1–P3
   floor and nothing tied a `scripts\go-loop-*.ps1` edit to
   `test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1`. The remedy is to RUN the named harness — red
   stays due, since only a clean green sweep re-stamps, and a run with skipped
   sections does not stamp at all. Adding a row to the coverage table in
   `scripts\guard-due.ps1` is the whole cost of closing the same gap for the
   next harness that grows one.

   **Two lines you may see there mean something different** (T1189).
   `GUARD DUE (advisory) ...` is a row whose question this box cannot answer at
   all - today that is `release-artifacts-packaging`, which needs wixl and
   therefore Docker, and starting Docker is the user's call. It is reported and
   never fails `validate`; its teeth are elsewhere (fork-ci compiles the package
   on every push, and `validate` fails on a red CI verdict). Clear it from the
   run that proved it rather than reaching for the hatch:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\guard-due.ps1 stamp-ci -Guard release-artifacts-packaging
   ```

   which stamps only when the covered files at that green run's commit are byte
   for byte the ones on disk. And `-NoGuardDue` now NAMES what it excused, so
   the hatch is readable after the fact instead of one line that fit every
   case.

   **A new gate ships with the demonstration that it can fail, or it is not a
   gate** (T1133). A check that has never been observed saying anything but
   "fine" is indistinguishable from a check that cannot say anything else, and
   this month that cost three times: the upstream verdict answered a weaker
   question than the one it existed to answer and stayed green through it
   (T1099), the go-loop guard sat 26-red for a day (T783), and the push rule
   was a habit for two weeks before it was a check (T1057). So when you add a
   refusal to `go-loop-exec.ps1 claim` or `parity-tasks.ps1 validate`,
   construct the state it is supposed to catch and prove it goes red, in

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File test\win32\gate-negatives.ps1
   ```

   which carries the registry of every condition those two gates report. A
   condition that is neither declared a gate with a demonstration nor declared
   an informational line FAILS that harness, so an undemonstrated gate cannot
   ship quietly. `-NegativeControl` is its own proof that it can score red.
4. **Make sure it's right** — validation must actually pass, on the box. A
   clean build is not evidence, and neither is a passing script you did not
   read the last line of.
5. **Assess whether more tasks are needed** — every bug, gap, or surprise the
   work turned up becomes a NEW task file, minted with
   `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 new -Title "…"`. Loose threads are how work gets
   lost. Never hand-pick an id; `new` allocates atomically so a second agent
   filing at the same moment cannot collide with you.

   **Read the `SIMILAR:` block when it prints** (T651). `new` names existing
   tasks whose titles look like the one you are filing, before it writes the
   file, because the same defect used to be filed three times - the T400
   stale-debounce flake as T615, then T643, then T649, by three turns that had
   each just watched the lane go red. It warns and never blocks, so the filing
   still happens; if one of the named tasks is the same defect, close YOUR
   duplicate in the same breath rather than leaving the backlog counting one
   problem twice. `parity-tasks.ps1 similar -Title "..."` asks the question
   without filing anything.
5b. **File any judgement call as a decision.** You never stop to ask (THE
   CONTEXT RULE), and that stays true — but a call the user might want to
   overturn gets a receipt, so it reaches them without blocking you:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-decisions.ps1 new ^
       -Title "<the question, phrased as a question>" -Task T123 ^
       -Assumed "<what you did meanwhile, so work continued>" ^
       -Options "Do X (Recommended)::Pros: a | b::Cons: c::Mitigation: d;;Do Y::Pros: e::Cons: f | g" ^
       -Why "<what forced the choice, in two or three sentences>"
   ```

   It surfaces at the top of the dashboard's Activity feed
   (`scripts\task-dashboard.ps1`). When the user picks an option, the answer
   is folded into the linked task automatically — so the reply lands where
   whoever picks that task up will see it.

   **What belongs here changed on 2026-08-14** (user directive, recorded in
   D46's resolution): the user can adjudicate EXPERIENCE, not implementation
   — "the how is very foreign to me". Before filing, apply the **experience
   test**: *could the user tell the options apart by using the app?*

   - **No — the options differ only in mechanism** (which API or control,
     which module, which wire shape, where a value is computed, how a test or
     script is structured, build/delivery/tracker process): this is YOUR
     call, not a decision to file. Make it — weigh robustness, performance,
     user experience, scale over time, stability, and parity as always —
     and record the choice and its why in the task file and the log.
     "Consider the feature's goal and presentation, make it work and look
     just like the Mac experience, pick the best tech and approach to bring
     parity" is standing policy, not a question to ask.
   - **Yes — the options produce experiences the user could tell apart**, and
     the Mac-to-Windows translation is genuinely ambiguous (no native
     counterpart, a Windows convention that pulls against Mac's look, a
     behavior that cannot be carried across exactly): file it, framed as the
     experience gap. These are the ONLY decisions that should reach the
     user's Activity feed.

   **What does not belong** (unchanged): anything you can settle by reading
   the code or running something — investigate instead; a decision is not a
   way to outsource work. Anything the tracker already answers. And never
   file one and then wait: keep going, exactly as before.

   Write it for someone who will never read the code and does not know
   win32. The TITLE names what the user would see or feel, never the
   mechanism ("When the banner collapses, should its text fade out like
   Mac's?", not "Should the collapse AlphaBlend an offscreen DIB?"). `-Why`
   states the experience gap in plain terms: what Mac shows, what Windows
   would show under each option, and why the translation is not obvious.
   Each option's LABEL says what the user gets; its Pros/Cons lead with
   user-visible consequences, with implementation detail after or not at
   all. If the question cannot be phrased without API or module names, that
   is the tell it fails the experience test — answer it yourself.

   Each option carries **Pros:** and **Cons:** lists (`|` between
   items) — a list without both is not a choice, it is a quiz — and where a
   con can be reduced, a **Mitigation:** naming the extra work that reduces
   it ("adds complexity" → a thorough design pass to make sure the shape is
   the one that scales; "touches shared core" → cross-platform tests on both
   lanes first). If the mitigation is real work, file it with
   `parity-tasks.ps1 new` so picking that option does not silently drop its
   safety net. The dashboard renders these as bulleted Pros/Cons columns, so
   keep each item one crisp clause, not a paragraph.

   Exactly ONE option's label ends in **"(Recommended)"**, and that option is
   **listed first**: the pick that best balances robustness, performance,
   user experience, scale over time, and stability, with the fewest
   sacrifices. **Implementation effort and time are NEVER part of that
   balance** (user directive, 2026-08-05): we have time to get things right,
   and what a choice costs in engineering hours is not what it costs the
   customer. "Cheapest" and "fastest" are not pros; "no named experiment left
   that could produce information" is a valid con, because that is about
   evidence, not effort. (`parity-decisions.ps1` sorts the recommended option
   to the front and warns if the flag count is not exactly one.)
6. **Update the tracker** — `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 set-status <id> -Status
   done -Commit <sha>`, evidence into that task's own file, ONE log entry in
   `docs/design/windows-parity-log.md`. Run `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1
   validate` before committing. Commit and push.

   **Commit through the guard, not with a bare `git commit -a`** (T948) — you
   share this working tree, and therefore this INDEX, with the other Claude
   window:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\git-commit-guard.ps1 commit ^
       -Paths 'src\...','docs\design\windows-parity-log.md' -MessageFile temp\msg.txt
   ```

   It holds a seconds-long advisory lock across stage→commit (the other
   window's commit is REFUSED by the `pre-commit` hook while it is held, with
   the remedy in the message), commits with an explicit pathspec so whatever
   else is sitting in the shared index cannot ride along, and then READS THE
   COMMIT BACK and fails loudly if it contains a path you did not ask for. On
   2026-08-17 the other window's `git add -A; git commit` landed in the gap
   between this loop's `git add` and its `git commit`: a whole clipboard fix
   shipped under a subject describing none of it, and it was pushed before
   anyone noticed. `install` (which step 0's claim re-runs every turn) is what
   arms the hook — `core.hooksPath` is local config, so it never arrives by
   `git pull`. `status` / `release -Force` are the escape hatches, and a hold
   older than its ttl is cleared rather than obeyed, so a crashed holder cannot
   wedge the repo. Acceptance: section W of `test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1`.

   **The message file has to have been written for THIS commit** (T1245). A
   `-MessageFile` that does not exist is REFUSED and the path is named, an
   empty one is refused too, and a message that HAS been committed is deleted —
   so a leftover from an earlier turn cannot be picked up silently. On
   2026-09-01 a turn passed `-MessageFile temp\msg2.txt` without writing it,
   and the previous turn's file was still sitting there: the commit recording
   T1195's sha went out titled after T1170, into the activity feed, pushed.

   **That commit PUSHES on its own** (T1057) — `commit` pushes by default, and
   a rejected push is answered the way step 4 says to (pull with rebase, push
   again) rather than reported and left. `-NoPush -Reason "<why>"` is the only
   way to leave a commit on this box, and it says so on the way past. The other
   half is a gate: `validate` FAILS when HEAD is ahead of its upstream, and
   step 0's claim reports the same thing at the top of the turn, so a finished
   task cannot be narrated over a commit that never left the machine. The
   `-NoPushCheck` hatch is for a box with no network and prints that it was
   used. Acceptance: section W of `test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1`.

   Since T1219 `validate` also FAILS when the build machine says the branch head
   does not build. Same two-ended arrangement as the push check above: step 0's
   claim reports the verdict, this gate refuses the commit, and an in-progress
   run passes so the loop is never stopped by its own in-flight build. Fix the
   build, or take `-NoCiCheck` when the red belongs to somebody else's commit.

   Since T783 `validate` is also the gate with TEETH for harness staleness: it
   fails when `scripts\guard-due.ps1` reports an acceptance harness that has not
   been run since the code it covers changed (step 3). Run that harness; the
   `-NoGuardDue` hatch exists for a harness that genuinely cannot run on this
   box and prints that it was used, so a commit made under it can be explained
   rather than silently excused.

   Since T847 `validate` also fails on STRANDED WORK — paths that step 0's
   claim found already dirty and that are still dirty now. Resolve them the way
   the claim report says (own commit / revert / `ack-stranded` to a filed
   task); acceptance is section S of `test\win32\go-loop-guard.ps1`.

   Since T564 `set-status` **journals every transition** into the task's own
   `## Progress log` (`status: <old> -> <new>`, plus `[commit <sha>]`), so a
   status change is never the silent edit it used to be — and the old status is
   preserved verbatim, which is the only place a discarded `blocked(reason)`
   survives. Pass `-SourceNote "<who asked>"` when the reason is not obvious
   from the turn. `-NoNote` exists for a bulk normalisation pass and nothing
   else.

   Since T892 the one transition that needs more than a receipt is the way OUT
   of `blocked(...)`: it asserts that the park condition is satisfied, so
   `set-status` refuses it without `-SourceNote "<what you checked>"` and prints
   the task's `unblock:` text back at you. Two evidence-free reopens of T443's
   armed watch each cost the following turn its whole context.

   **Your commit message is the activity feed.** The dashboard builds each
   feed item from the commit that finished the work: the subject becomes the
   headline, the first paragraph of the body becomes "what changed", and the
   tasks completed and filed in that commit hang off it. Write the subject as
   a plain statement of what now behaves differently, and open the body with a
   paragraph a reader can understand without the diff. That is already the
   house style — this is just what depends on it.

   Refresh the lock while you are here
   (`scripts\go-loop-lock.ps1 heartbeat`). Since T253 this is a checkpoint,
   not the loop's only pulse: the lock also follows the session transcript's
   mtime, which Claude Code advances on every message and tool result, so a
   long turn no longer reads as stale just because nobody ran a command. The
   manual refresh still matters as the fallback for a session whose transcript
   could not be resolved (`acquire` says which: `pulse=transcript` vs
   `pulse=heartbeat-only`).
6.5. **The user's terminal is not yours to swap; publish to it instead**
   (T1218/T1220; decision D85, 2026-08-31). One command at this step, and it is
   a publish rather than a swap:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\daily-publish.ps1
   ```

   Exit **0** = not due, or skipped with a named reason. Exit **10** = published
   (the tag is in the line above it). Exit **1** = it was due and the publish
   failed, and nothing was released. **All three end the turn the same way** -
   carry on to step 7. A publish must never be able to stall the loop.

   Until 2026-08-31 this step ran a morning refresh that replaced the user's
   installed Ghoztty out of a repo build. D85 put the question to them and the
   answer was the option the loop had NOT assumed:

   > "the terminal should only ever run something that was actually published"

   So the installed app at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ghoztty` is the product, and
   the ONLY thing that may replace it is the in-app updater taking a published
   release. `scripts\install-ownership.ps1` is the rule;
   `scripts\upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` and `scripts\launch-upgrade.ps1` refuse
   a user-install target rather than merely defaulting away from it, and
   `test\win32\install-ownership.ps1` is the demonstration that the refusal
   actually fires.

   What that changes for a turn:

   - **Getting today's work to the user is a PUBLISH, and it is automatic**
     (T1220). `daily-publish.ps1` fires on the first task-boundary push at or
     after **17:00 local** each day - a real signal that the day's work is good,
     the way the retired morning refresh keyed on a push rather than a clock -
     **or, if that hour was never reached, on the first push once 24 hours have
     passed since the last publish** (T1292: on 2026-09-02 the loop's last push
     was 14:28 and it then stalled, so the evening gate never fired and the day
     shipped nothing, silently). It carries everything that landed since the
     last one. Their terminal then offers the update the way it does for every
     other user, which is also the T1179 install-and-update walk being exercised
     continuously instead of once.

     **It publishes by pushing the tag, not by packaging here** (T1292). The
     `win-v<Version>` tag goes onto HEAD and up to origin
     (`scripts\publish-windows-tag.ps1`), and `release-windows.yml` builds the
     MSI and the portable ZIP on ubuntu-latest and creates the release. Before
     this it ran `publish-windows-release.ps1`, which packages with wixl inside
     the msitools **Docker** image - a precondition this box is forbidden to
     satisfy, so the publish asked for it every evening, logged a polite SKIP and
     shipped nothing for three days while nineteen tasks closed. `-Local`
     reinstates the packaging path for a box that wants it.

     **The daily cadence is the FLOOR, not the ceiling** (T1294). One publish per
     day strands everything that lands after it: on 2026-09-03 the release went
     out at 09:28, the fix for the installer bug the user had reported that
     morning landed at 11:01, and the evening run answered `already published
     today` — so they downloaded the same broken installer and reported the same
     bug again, with 24 commits sitting behind that date. **When the work you just
     landed is something somebody is waiting for — anything filed from a user
     report, and anything whose task says a user hit it — record a request
     BEFORE step 6.5**:

     ```
     powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\daily-publish.ps1 -Request ^
         -Reason "T1291: the installer dies silently on a same-version install"
     ```

     It publishes nothing itself; the step 6.5 run seconds later, after the
     commit guard has pushed, ships it despite the day's watermark. An ordinary
     turn files no request and the one-a-day cadence is untouched, so this is not
     a route to publish-per-commit. A request with nothing behind it clears
     itself rather than minting an empty release, and one the loop has NOT
     honoured within three hours degrades `go-loop-health.ps1`. **A task closed
     from a user report is not done from where the user stands until the fix has
     shipped** — the request is how that stops being a thing to remember.

     **And since T1315 you do not have to remember it at all.** A task that came
     from a user carries `user-report: true` — `parity-tasks.ps1 new -UserReport`
     writes it, `set-priority <id> -UserReport` adds it when triage recognises
     one — and `set-status <id> -Status done` on such a task files the request
     ITSELF, with the task id and title as the reason, and writes the receipt
     into the task's progress log. `validate` then FAILS on `UNSHIPPED USER
     REPORT`: a closed user report whose log carries no publish request. In
     ordinary operation the gate never fires, because the close filed the
     request; what it catches is a status hand-edited in the file, a request
     write that failed, and a task retro-flagged after it was already closed —
     all three of which the user experiences identically, as a fix they were
     told about and cannot install. Flag it when you file it; the hand-run
     `-Request` above stays the way to ask for anything else. Acceptance:
     section F of `test\win32\gate-negatives.ps1`.

     **A pushed tag is not yet a release**, so the watermark records `tagged` and
     the next run reconciles it against `gh release view`: `published` if CI
     built it, `failed` if an hour passed and no release exists.

     **The version is decided, not defaulted.** A Windows release tracks the
     newest Mac `vX.Y.Z` line and walks the PATCH from there:
     `v1.37.0` -> `win-v1.37.0`, `win-v1.37.1`, `win-v1.37.2` ... one per
     publishing day, until the next Mac release pulls the base up. So the number
     the user sees names the Mac line their build corresponds to, the daily walk
     never squats on a Mac minor that has not shipped, and the version is
     derived from the releases that EXIST, so it cannot collide with one.

     **A publish that cannot run is a SKIP, never a failure.** In the default
     tag mode that is one condition - HEAD must already be on the remote, which
     the commit guard sees to; under `-Local` it is the old pair, Docker Desktop
     up and `gh` authenticated. The reason is named in the log, the watermark is
     NOT consumed - so a later push the same day still publishes - and the turn
     carries on. `-Check` asks the question without doing anything; `-Force`
     publishes a second time in a day on purpose.
     Acceptance: `test\win32\daily-publish.ps1`.

     **And a skip is no longer invisible.** `publish=` on
     `scripts\go-loop-health.ps1` reads the watermark and reports
     `ok` / `stale-<n>d` / `failed` / `never`, degrading the run when nothing has
     shipped for a day - the same shape as `digest=`, for the same reason. The
     morning digest names what shipped, and names the absence when nothing did.
     Since T1294 it also answers the *other* question that `ok` used to hide:
     `publish=ok+<n>` means the release exists and **n commits have landed since
     it**, which was the true and misleading state on 2026-09-03.
   - **To run what you just built, run what you just built.**
     `zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe` directly, or point the upgrade script at the dev
     install (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghoztty\dev-install`), which the loop owns.
   - **Never reach for a "just this once" swap.** That failure is silent by
     construction: the swap succeeds, the terminal keeps working, and the only
     symptom is a version number describing bytes nobody ever released.
6.9. **The ship workflow — where a turn's commit goes** (T1058). Today it goes
   straight onto `users/dzearing/windows-amd64`, and steps 1 and 6 above are
   written for that. That is the CURRENT path and it stays the current path
   until the cutover happens; nothing below changes what you do today.

   What changes it is the cutover to `origin/main` plus per-feature worktrees
   and pull requests (user directive, 2026-08-21). The whole transition — entry
   criteria, the merge itself, and the turn shape after it — is
   `docs/design/windows-parity-ship-workflow.md`. Two commands and one rule are
   worth knowing before you get there:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\ship-readiness.ps1 -RunLanes
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\ship-feature.ps1 list
   ```

   - `ship-readiness.ps1` answers whether the branch may become the trunk. Ten
     criteria, each a number or an exit code, and an **unmeasured** criterion
     counts as unmet — a lane that was green yesterday says nothing about
     today's tree. Exit 0 is the only thing that authorises the cutover.
   - `ship-feature.ps1 new|list|pr|done` is the lifecycle afterwards: a worktree
     off a freshly fetched `main`, a branch, a PR against the fork, and a
     teardown that refuses to delete unpushed work. **After the cutover,
     `list` runs BEFORE step 1's `next`**: an open, unmerged PR is inherited
     work and outranks a fresh task, exactly the way a `RESUME:` outranks a
     `NEXT:`.
   - **Never run a repository-scoped `gh` command here without `--repo`.** This
     repo has `upstream` (ghostty-org/ghostty) as a remote and `gh` resolves to
     it by default; a bare `gh pr create` would offer this fork's Windows work
     to the public Ghostty project, and that is not retractable. The scripts
     pass `--repo dzearing/ghoztty` on every call and
     `test\win32\ship-workflow.ps1` section C fails if one stops.

   The cutover is gated on work that is not this seat's: **T87** (the Mac
   regression build) and the 93 `origin/main` commits that must be merged into
   this branch first. `ship-readiness.ps1` names both every time it runs, so the
   gap is a report rather than a thing to remember.

7. **`/reset-context read go.md and go`, and end the turn there.**

**Ending a turn any other way is a failure, not a pause.** The loop
perpetuates itself through step 7. A turn that stops after step 6 to report
success leaves the loop dead — that already cost six days (2026-07-21 →
2026-07-27) and killed it again on 2026-07-28. Finishing a task is not a
reason to stop; finishing IS the trigger to reset and take the next one.

Since T139 there IS a supervisor, but do not lean on it: the watchdog
(`scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1`) re-enters only after tens of minutes of dead
time. It is the safety net for a crash, not a substitute for step 7.

**And it will catch a continuation you typed but never sent** (T1319), which is
worth knowing precisely so you do not rely on it. Step 7 is not "type the
reset", it is "submit it": on 2026-09-04 turn 86 ended with `/rc` sitting in the
composer, and because typing it refreshed the session transcript — the signal
the watchdog trusted — the supervisor logged `healthy` every five minutes over a
2h32m stall. The watchdog now decides by the lock's `turn_age` (only a completed
turn moves it, so a nudge cannot buy health) and reads a pane holding UNSENT
composer text as a stalled turn rather than as activity. That closes the hole in
tens of minutes; ending the turn properly closes it in zero.

The supervisor has its own supervision (T440): it stamps a heartbeat on every
tick, the dashboard shows a "Supervisor is down" line when that stops, and a
per-user scheduled task re-launches it every 10 minutes (a no-op while it is
alive — the single-instance mutex sees to that). Before T440 it was an HKCU Run
entry alone, which fires at logon and never again; it died at 09:14 one morning
and nothing noticed for thirteen hours. Ask it directly with:

```
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\go-loop-watchdog.ps1 -Status
```

**And ask whether the loop is WORKING, not merely alive** (T1290).
`scripts\go-loop-health.ps1` now reports `turn_age=` beside `uptime=`: how long
the current turn has been running, from a lock field only a completed turn moves.
Every other clock on that line measures liveness — a pid, a port, a pane that
produced output — and on 2026-09-03 the loop sat inert for 14.5 hours reading
HEALTHY, six minutes after the watchdog's own nudge had refreshed the transcript
the verdict was keying off. A nudge is a treatment, not evidence. Past
`-TurnStaleMinutes` (180) the run is DEGRADED and the note sends you to read the
pane — three stalls running were theorised about from the ledger when
`ghoztty +read --name=<pane>` had the answer, which that week was
`API Error: 529 Overloaded`. `-Postmortem` prints that tail for you.

The watchdog reads that same clock as of T1319, on the same default — so the
thing that REPORTS a stall and the thing that RECOVERS one can no longer
disagree, which they did for two and a half hours on 2026-09-04 with the
observer right and the actor wrong.

The one allowed exception: if the reset probe finds this session is not in a
Ghoztty pane, say so plainly and ask the user to run `/clear`.

## THE CONTEXT RULE (read this first, it overrides everything below)

**One task per context. Then reset. No exceptions.**

A previous session ignored this and ran to a 716k-token context by chaining
task after task. Long contexts get slow, expensive, and forgetful — and the
work is *already* durable in git + the tracker doc, so there is nothing to
"keep in your head" across tasks.

Concretely:

1. Pick exactly **one** task (`scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 next`).
2. Do it: implement → validate on the box → update the task file + session
   log → commit → push.
3. **STOP and reset context.** Do NOT keep working after invoking a reset —
   the clear only fires when your turn ends, so continuing silently cancels
   it (this is exactly how the 716k session happened).
   - `/reset-context` works on this box as of 2026-07-13 IF this session
     runs inside the installed release Ghoztty
     (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ghoztty\ghoztty.exe`, on the user PATH,
     IPC-capable, refreshed via T36). The skill's Step 1 branches on
     `/proc/self/winpid` → `ghoztty +list --pid=…` (fixed in the
     dzearing-claude-marketplace repo + the plugin cache).
   - If the session is NOT in a Ghoztty pane (e.g. Windows Terminal, or the
     old pre-IPC portable build), the probe returns nothing — then **ask
     the user to run `/clear`** and stop, as before.
4. The fresh session re-reads this file and the tracker, and picks up the
   next task with a clean context.

**Check your context usage at every task boundary.** If you are above ~150k,
reset even if you feel mid-flow. If a single task pushes you past ~250k, the
task is too big: split it into sub-tasks (e.g. "T19a design" + "T19
implement" — `parity-tasks.ps1 new`, then set the parent to
`skipped(split → …)`), commit the split, and reset.

**Keep tool output small.** Prefer `zig build ... 2>&1 | Select-String error`
over dumping full build logs; prefer `| Select-Object -Last 1` on acceptance
scripts (they print a single ALL PASS / N FAILURE(S) line by design). Read
only the parts of files you need.

**NEVER pipe a build into `Select-Object -First N`.** `-First` STOPS the
pipeline once it has N items, which tears down the still-running native
command: `zig build` dies mid-run and reports **exit -1 with no failure
text**. This is a FALSE failure and it has already been mis-filed twice as a
"transient exit=-1" flake (T89h, then T89i). `-Last N` is safe (it must drain
the whole stream). When you want the first few matches, redirect first and
filter the file: `zig build test -Dapp-runtime=win32 *> $log; "exit:
$LASTEXITCODE"; Select-String -Path $log -Pattern 'error:' | Select-Object
-First 10`. Rule of thumb: a lane that "fails" with warnings but no `error:`
line did not fail — re-run it unfiltered before believing it.

**Set `ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR` to a path on the repo's drive** —
`$env:ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR = 'D:\zig-global-cache'` — in every shell you build
or test from. Zig 0.15.2's build runner cannot make a path on one drive relative
to a cwd on another and asserts instead of saying so, so the default `C:` cache
turns any build here into `panic: reached unreachable code` out of
`std/Build/Step/Run.zig` with nothing pointing at your change. Same trap shape as
the `-First N` rule above, and it has been paid at least four times: since T243
`build.zig` refuses such a shell up front with `error:
GlobalCacheOnDifferentDrive` and the line to paste, so if you see that message
the fix is the message.

## What to do

1. **Tasks live one-per-file** in `docs/design/windows-parity-tasks/`
   (`T<id>.md`, YAML frontmatter + Summary + Details). This replaced the
   single state table on 2026-07-29 so two agents can file and edit tasks
   without writing to the same file — see that directory's `README.md` for
   the format and the full command set.

   **Do not read the directory wholesale.** Use the script, then read only
   the one task file you are working:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 next
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 show T144
   ```

   `docs/design/windows-parity-tasks.md` is still worth reading for its
   narrative sections — the resume protocol and the key code landmarks — but
   its **state table is frozen**: a historical snapshot, no longer ground
   truth. Never add a row to it. **Current priorities** is frozen too as of
   2026-08-21 (T345): every task it names is closed, and `next` is the
   ordering authority now. Do not add to it; re-triage with `set-priority`
   instead, which moves the queue and leaves a receipt. Likewise `windows-parity-details.md` is frozen; its
   per-task sections were copied into the task files, and the task file
   wins. The session log (`windows-parity-log.md`), the audit appendix
   (`windows-parity-audit.md`), and the spec (`windows-parity-spec.md`) are
   unchanged — open at most the one section you actually need, never all of
   them "for background".
   **The live status dashboard** answers "where is this project" without
   reading any task file. It renders in a Ghoztty viewer pane and refreshes
   itself as task and decision files change:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\task-dashboard.ps1
   ```

   Three views behind a side nav: **Activity** (open decisions that need the
   user, then a timeline of what landed), **Data** (the charts), **Tasks**
   (lookup and filtering, newest first). Decisions are filed by step 5b below
   and live in `docs/design/windows-parity-decisions/`.

   That starts a small localhost server (detached, survives the session) and
   splits a viewer pane **off the pane you ran it from** — it defaults
   `--target` to `$GHOZTTY_PANE_ID`, because a bare `+split` targets the most
   recently focused window and lands somewhere else. Both halves are
   idempotent: re-running reuses the server and focuses the existing pane.
   `-Stop` kills the server, `-NoPane` skips the split, `-Port` moves it off
   7788. It is served over http rather than written to a `.html` file, which
   since T601 is for its own reasons and no longer because a viewer would show
   the source: the dashboard fetches its data from the server and re-renders as
   task files change, which a static file cannot do. A local `.html` pane now
   renders the page (with live reload on save), so a page that needs no server
   does not need one. After a reboot, run it again.
2. Work **one** task, per the context rule above. At the boundary, record
   status and evidence in the task's own file, and append ONE short entry to
   `windows-parity-log.md` (no build output, no diffs). Run
   `scripts\parity-tasks.ps1 validate` before you commit.
3. The repo CLAUDE.md is written from the Mac seat (app bundles, unix
   sockets, /Applications paths). Where it conflicts with the tracker doc,
   the tracker doc wins on Windows. The "never touch /Applications/
   Ghoztty.app" rule has an on-box analog: never touch an installed
   Ghoztty under Program Files or the user's extracted portable dir —
   always run the freshly built `zig-out\bin\ghoztty.exe`.

   **Build it with `-Doptimize=Debug`, and not for speed** (T350): the app's
   IPC pipe, the local agent's pipe and the state directory are all derived
   from the build mode, and a non-debug `zig-out` derives *the user's* — so the
   whole acceptance suite silently drives the terminal they are sitting in and
   passes. That is **endpoint isolation**, it is what the flag buys, and a
   private `GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX` does not substitute for it — it moves the APP
   endpoint alone, and a release build under it still dials the agent holding
   the user's live sessions. Isolating a release-lineage run takes all THREE
   knobs (`GHOZTTY_PIPE_SUFFIX`, `GHOZTTY_AGENT_INSTANCE` for the agent's pipe /
   state dir / autostart, `LOCALAPPDATA` for the files), which
   `Set-GhozttyTestIsolation -ReleaseSandbox` sets in one call. Acceptance
   scripts now refuse such a build before they
   launch anything (`test\win32\lib\BuildMode.ps1`, which since T1158 checks the
   sandbox rather than taking the caller's word); if you hit that refusal,
   rebuild rather than reach for the `GHOZTTY_TEST_ALLOW_RELEASE=1` opt-in,
   which exists for the handful of scripts whose subject IS the release build.
4. Sync discipline: `git pull` before starting, and **push immediately after
   EVERY commit** — mid-task small commits included, never only at the task
   boundary (user directive, 2026-08-07: "we should also PUSH them to
   remote, not just horde them locally"). An unpushed commit is invisible to
   the other seat and every parallel session, and dies with a crashed box.
   If the push is rejected, pull/rebase and push before continuing.

## Standing quality bar (from the user, 2026-07-12; expanded 2026-07-15)

- Full parity with every Mac feature that translates; build Windows-native
  equivalents where the concept doesn't (e.g. shell flavors, `+list --pid`
  instead of `--tty`).
- **No mega files.** Split modules as they grow (see `src/apprt/win32/`
  IpcServer/IpcHandlers/IpcRegistry and `src/apprt/ipc/args.zig`).
- **Everything gets tests.** Pure logic → unit tests in the none-runtime
  lane; behavior → an on-box validation script. Both test lanes
  (`-Dapp-runtime=none` and `-Dapp-runtime=win32`) must be green, `zig build
  test-agent` must be green (agent floor, T89b), and the P1–P3 acceptance
  scripts in `test/win32/` must stay ALL PASS.
- **Reliable and fast under long-context use** (2026-07-15): no crashes,
  no slowdowns, tuned for hours-long Claude Code sessions (T53 tracks the
  soak/tuning pass). Windows UI affordances should look Windows-native,
  not like bare controls (T50 is the pattern-setter).
- **Fully autonomous** (2026-07-15): the user steps away — never stop to
  ask clarifying questions mid-process; audit your own trail; use
  adversarial investigation for hard problems and recommended approaches
  where they exist. After a task: verify, mark the doc, audit the task
  list for gaps, commit/push, `/reset-context read go.md and go`, repeat.
- **Deliver by PUBLISHING** when a fix matters to the user (T1218/D85,
  2026-08-31 — this bullet used to say "deliver to every install location", and
  the installed release was one of them). The installed release
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ghoztty`) is the user's, and only the in-app
  updater may replace it, with a published build. The Desktop portable
  (`D:\Users\David\Desktop\Ghoztty-portable-x64`) and the share copy
  (`\\homeassistant\share\ghoztty-windows`) are still scripted delivery
  targets, and they are what `deliver-windows-build.ps1` proves below. A fix
  that only lives in zig-out still does not exist as far as the user can tell
  (the T49 lesson) — the answer to that is now a release, not a swap.

  **Locations 2 and 3 are scripted now, and every claim they make is measured**
  (T198). `launch-upgrade.ps1` runs `scripts\deliver-windows-build.ps1`
  in-process, after the staging build and before it launches the detached
  upgrade, so a failure over there happens while someone is still watching; the
  child upgrade is then told `-NoExtraInstalls` so the verified path and the old
  best-effort mirror never both copy. What the script proves, rather than
  asserts: every delivered file matches its staging source (length + mtime;
  SHA-256 under `-DeepVerify`), every delivered `ghoztty.exe`/`ghoztty.com`
  answers `+version` with the commit being shipped, their PE subsystems are
  GUI/console (a console `ghoztty.exe` is a Debug build), every delivered
  `ghoztty-agent.exe` — including the share's loose copy — answers `--version`
  with the STAGED agent's build stamp (T281; the agent carries a
  `YYYYMMDD-<hash>` stamp rather than the app's semver, so what is measured is
  "these bytes are the staged bytes"), and the portable ZIP is rebuilt from an
  explicit manifest — root entry `Ghoztty\`, no `.pdb`, no `.bak*` — with its
  entry set diffed against the artifact it replaces. An unannounced shape change
  fails the run and the zip is NOT published; pass `-AcceptZipShape` (through
  `launch-upgrade.ps1` too) when the shipped file set legitimately moved.

  Why the checking rather than just the copying: T196's hand-built zip exited 0
  and was wrong twice over (double-nested root, both `.pdb` files, 20.3 MB →
  41.9 MB), and on 2026-08-10 both portable locations were found holding a
  **Debug** `ghoztty.exe` beside a release `ghoztty.com` an hour after the
  morning refresh had logged `extra install '...': ghoztty.exe, ghoztty.com,
  ...`. The copy reported success; nothing read the result back.

  An unreachable location is SKIPPED and named in the verdict, never a failure —
  a sleeping NAS must not hold up the install the user is sitting in front of. A
  location that is present and WRONG is a failure, which is the distinction the
  old best-effort mirror could not make. Run it standalone with `-DryRun` to see
  what it would replace; `-PruneBackups <keep>` is how the `.bak-*` pile is
  trimmed (it is only ever OFFERED, since deleting is user-gated). Acceptance:
  `test\win32\deliver-windows-build.ps1`.
- **Never override `-ResumeCommand` on `scripts/upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1`**
  (2026-07-18): the default (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
  --continue "read go.md and go"`) is what re-enters this loop after the
  kill/swap. A plain `claude` override relaunched a blank session and
  stalled the loop for ~1.5 days (2026-07-17 02:32 → user return). The
  script now substitutes the default for any --continue-less override
  unless `-AllowPlainResume` is passed. Also finish the turn (commit,
  tracker updated) BEFORE launching the script — it kills Claude after
  `-DelaySeconds`.
- **The launcher now BUILDS the staging release and refuses to ship anything
  else** (2026-07-31, T208). `upgrade-ghoztty-windows.ps1` still never builds —
  it copies whatever sits in `zig-out-release` — so `launch-upgrade.ps1` does it
  first, with the exact incantation that used to be a remembered precondition:

  ```powershell
  zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32 -Doptimize=ReleaseFast `
      -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-gnu -Dstrip=false --prefix zig-out-release
  ```

  It then reads the staged exe's `+version` and compares the baked commit
  against `git rev-parse --short HEAD`. A mismatch is **STALE STAGING**: the
  launcher exits 3 and nothing is delivered. The upgrade script re-checks the
  same number before the kill (a stale prefix skips the swap entirely and the
  installed release is left untouched) and reads the *installed* exe back after
  the swap, so `UPGRADE OK` means the right bits are on disk rather than "a file
  copy returned success". Then it mirrors to the Desktop portable and the
  `\\homeassistant\share` copy, best-effort.

  **The agent is held to that same standard** (T281). `agent exe swapped` used
  to mean only that `Move-Item` + `Copy-Item` did not throw — and that branch has
  a `WARNING:` path where neither ran (2026-07-20: the `.bak` was the still-mapped
  image of the running agent, undeletable AND unrenameable), so a delivery could
  leave a months-old `ghoztty-agent.exe` on disk and still say `UPGRADE OK`. It
  now reads the installed agent's `--version` back and compares its build stamp
  against the STAGED agent's; a mismatch is `AGENT VERIFY FAILED` and the run is
  a failure with nothing propagated onward. What is deliberately NOT asserted is
  the RUNNING agent's build — it is expected to be older, which is the whole
  lazy-upgrade contract — and `-AppOnly` (the morning refresh, which ships no
  agent at all) logs `AGENT VERIFY SKIP` rather than failing every morning. The
  mirrored locations are read back too, as a `WARNING` naming the location: they
  are best-effort by design, but silence was the wrong outcome. Acceptance:
  section E of `test\win32\upgrade-staleness.ps1`, whose negative control holds
  the `.bak` open with `FileShare.None` to reproduce the 2026-07-20 skipped swap.

  Why all that: skipping the build shipped the PREVIOUS delivery's binary while
  `LAUNCH OK`, `exe swapped` and `UPGRADE OK` all reported success. That happened
  delivering T202 — the installed release still reported `+9968a62d9`
  afterwards. **A delivery is still not done until you have READ that commit
  back** from `ghoztty +version`; the gates make a lie loud, not unnecessary.

  Escape hatches, both loud in the log: `-SkipBuild` (I already built it — the
  freshness check still runs) and `-AllowStaleStaging` (ship a commit that is
  not HEAD, e.g. a deliberate rollback). Acceptance:
  `test\win32\upgrade-staleness.ps1`.

- **Launch that upgrade through `scripts/launch-upgrade.ps1`, never with a
  hand-rolled `Start-Process`** (2026-07-30, T200). Call it IN-PROCESS from
  the turn's last tool call so the prompt binds as one string:

  ```powershell
  & D:\git\ghoztty\scripts\launch-upgrade.ps1 `
      -Prompt '/reset-context <verify this delivery…> Then read go.md and go'
  ```

  It writes the prompt to a file (never argv), starts the upgrade detached,
  and then WAITS for the upgrade script's first log line before reporting
  success — so a launch that dies fails in *this* turn, while someone is
  still watching. Exit 0 = confirmed running; anything else = the installed
  release was NOT upgraded, so do not report the delivery as done.

  **Give that tool call a long timeout** (T208): it now builds first, and a cold
  ReleaseFast build runs several minutes. A call that gets pushed to the
  background takes the "fails while someone is watching" guarantee with it. The
  cheap shape is to run the build in its own earlier tool call — the launcher's
  rebuild is then a no-op of a few seconds, and the build path still gets
  exercised, which `-SkipBuild` would skip.

  Why it exists: `Start-Process -ArgumentList @(…)` does not quote its
  elements, so a multi-word `-ResumePrompt` is re-tokenized into positional
  arguments. On 2026-07-30 that killed parameter binding *before* the
  script's first line — nothing logged, stderr thrown away with the hidden
  window — and the turn reported "upgrading now" over a delivery that never
  happened. The loop then sat dead for 45 minutes until the watchdog fired.
