/// A banner link is either a web URL or a local file (bare file paths
/// autolink). A plain click hands the link *out* of Ghoztty — a URL to the
/// system default browser, a file revealed in Finder. The modifiers bring it
/// back in: `Cmd` opens it in a viewer side pane (either kind), and
/// `Cmd-Shift` gives it a surface of its own — a new Ghoztty viewer window for
/// a URL, the file's own default app for a path.
///
/// A `ghoztty://` link is the exception to all of that: it names a window or
/// pane rather than content, so it runs in process (see `GhozttyURLScheme`)
/// under every modifier and never opens anything.
///
/// A URL leaves by default because Ghoztty's `WKWebView` keeps its own cookie
/// store with no relationship to Safari or Chrome: anything behind a login
/// renders logged-out in a viewer pane and OAuth sign-in never completes. The
/// browser is where the user's session already lives. Viewing in Ghoztty is
/// still one modifier — or one right-click — away.
///
/// Everything is resolved from a weak `LinkAnchor` at action time: the

/// splits) and the anchor's working directory (viewer provenance). With no
