///
/// A report is a single JSON object, not markdown-with-frontmatter. The body
/// is free-form multi-line prose the user typed; a body containing a `---`
/// line or a line that looks like `key: value` breaks naive frontmatter
/// splitting, whereas JSON escapes newlines inside a string and has exactly
/// one parse path in every language. The body value still holds markdown, so
/// a watcher that prints `report["body"]` gets a readable document with
/// working image links.
///

///
/// ```
