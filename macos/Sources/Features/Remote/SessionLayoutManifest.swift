/// Session persistence (design doc §5, T05): a durable manifest of every
/// LOCAL-agent-backed window's layout so a later launch can rebuild the
/// window — frame, split topology with exact directions/ratios, titles, IPC
/// names — and re-`ATTACH` each leaf to its still-running agent session.
///
/// This is the local sibling of `RemoteSessionManifest` (which records relay
/// remote windows, one session per window). The layout manifest differs in
/// two ways:
///
/// - It records the whole SPLIT TREE per window, with a session id per LEAF,
///   because persistent local windows are expected to carry nontrivial split
///   layouts that must come back exactly (directions, ratios).
/// - It lives in a JSON FILE (`Application Support/<bundle id>/
///   session-layout.json`, atomic tmp+rename writes) rather than
///   UserDefaults, so the E2E harness can assert on it directly and the
///   debug/release lineages stay separate via their bundle ids.
///
/// Lifecycle mirrors `RemoteSessionManifest`:
/// - An entry is **registered** when a window binds to the local agent
///   (`BaseTerminalController.remoteConnection` didSet) and is then kept in
///   sync on every split-tree change, window move/resize (debounced), and
///   title change. Leaf session ids are published asynchronously by the
///   termio thread, so a capture loop re-syncs until every leaf has one.
/// - The entry is **removed on a clean close** (user closed the window; see
///   `BaseTerminalController.windowWillClose`).
/// - The entry is **kept on app quit** (`AppDelegate.isQuitting`) so the next
///   launch can restore it (T06).
///
/// One entry per `TerminalController` — an AppKit tab is its own window +
/// controller, so a "window with tabs" persists as N entries sharing a
/// `tabGroupID` with ascending `tabIndex`. Restore groups them back together.
