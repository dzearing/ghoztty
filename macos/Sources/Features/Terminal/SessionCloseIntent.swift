/// Decides which leaves of a replaced surface tree get the "CLOSE my agent
/// session when I am freed" intent.
///
/// The default reading of a tree change is simple: a leaf that LEFT the tree
/// was closed by the user, so its agent session must actually END when the
/// view is eventually freed (after the undo window expires) rather than linger
/// detached in the agent forever. A leaf still PRESENT in the tree is alive, so
/// any pending intent is cleared — that is what un-marks a view brought back by
/// undo.
///
/// That reading is WRONG for a tree SWAP. In-place session recovery
/// (`SessionLayoutRestore.rebuildSessionLayoutController`) replaces a live
/// controller's whole `surfaceTree` with freshly built surfaces that re-ATTACH
/// the SAME agent sessions. Every old leaf "leaves the tree", but nobody closed
/// anything — and marking those leaves CLOSE-on-free means that whenever they
/// finally deallocate (they are retained by the undo stack / an autorelease
/// pool, so it can be minutes later) `Remote.threadExit` takes the CLOSE branch
/// and terminates the child of a session a live on-screen pane is using. That
/// is the 2026-07-21 incident: recovery killing the very sessions it recovered.
///
/// So the invariant is: **a session that is still referenced by the new tree is
/// never marked CLOSE-on-free.** Stating it in terms of session ids (rather
/// than special-casing the rebuild caller) means any future tree-replacing path
/// inherits the protection.
