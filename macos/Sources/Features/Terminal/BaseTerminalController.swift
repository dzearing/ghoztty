/// Usage: Specify this as the base class of your window controller for the window that contains
/// a terminal. The window controller must also be the window delegate OR the window delegate
/// functions on this base class must be called by your own custom delegate. For the terminal
/// view the TerminalView SwiftUI view must be used and this class is the view model and
/// delegate.
///
/// Special considerations to implement:
///
///   - Fullscreen: you must manually listen for the right notification and implement the
///   callback that calls toggleFullscreen on this base class.
///
/// Notably, things this class does NOT implement (not exhaustive):
///
///   - Tabbing, because there are many ways to get tabbed behavior in macOS and we
///   don't want to be opinionated about it.
///   - Window restoration or save state
///   - Window visual styles (such as titlebar colors)
///
/// The primary idea of all the behaviors we don't implement here are that subclasses may not
/// want these behaviors.
