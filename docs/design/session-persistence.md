## 1. Goal

The user runs many Ghoztty windows, each hosting a long-running process (dev
servers, Claude Code sessions). Today a Sparkle update, an app crash, or a
reboot kills every window and every child process. This design makes the
terminal *processes* independent of the *viewer* (the GUI app):

1. **App update (Sparkle relaunch)** — every child process keeps running
   (same PID); every window re-attaches afterward with correct layout, split
   ratios, sizes, titles, and scrollback.
2. **App crash** — same as update: next launch re-attaches to the still-running
   processes.
3. **Reboot / OS crash / agent crash** — no design can keep a local process
   alive across a reboot; the honest contract is **"session state restores,
   process relaunches."** Layout, cwd, command, and title come back; the
   process is restarted and visibly marked as such; scrollback restores up to
   the last persisted snapshot (best-effort).
4. **Portability** — a process runs in exactly one place. Any machine's
   Ghoztty can list the terminals running on any enrolled machine (local or
   remote), attach to one, detach, and re-attach from somewhere else —
   "moving" a window between machines. Single viewer at a time is sufficient.

Non-goals (v1): simultaneous multi-viewer attach; process survival across
reboot (impossible); collaborative sharing; predictive local echo.

## 2. Acceptance criteria

"Works extremely well" made concrete. These become the exit tests of the
phases in §8.

| # | Scenario | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AC1 | Sparkle update with 10 windows / 25 panes running `sleep`-style markers + a TUI (vim) + a scrolling logger | After relaunch: **all 25 child PIDs unchanged**; all windows re-created with identical split topology and ratios (±1%), window/tab titles (incl. user-set titles), working directories; scrollback present up to the retention limit; total interruption (quit → all panes interactive) **< 10 s**; zero bytes of output produced *during* the gap lost (replayed on attach). |
| AC2 | `kill -9` the GUI app with the same layout | Next launch: same result as AC1. Processes never received SIGHUP. |
| AC3 | Reboot with 10 windows | After login + app launch: all windows restored with layout/titles/cwds; each pane **relaunched** with its original command and cwd and visibly marked "restarted after reboot"; scrollback restored from the last on-disk snapshot (best-effort, may trail by ≤ 30 s of output). |
| AC4 | Agent crash (`kill -9 ghoztty-agent`) | Children die (POSIX PTY semantics — documented, not hidden). Agent restarts via launchd ≤ 5 s; sessions relaunch from persisted metadata as in AC3. Covered both ways: **app relaunched** (reboot-equivalent, T12d) *and* **app stays up** (in-place, T12e) — the live app detects the dropped shared connection, re-dials the restarted agent, and rebuilds each open window's full split topology in place with the `--- session restarted ---` banner (the local machine pill stays hidden). |
| AC5 | Latency / throughput | Added keypress→echo latency of the agent hop vs today's in-process PTY: **p50 < 1 ms** measured end-to-end. `cat` of a 100 MB file into a pane: wall time within **25%** of a direct local PTY. No visible degradation at 120 Hz scrolling. |
| AC6 | Move window between machines | From Mac B: chooser lists Mac A's sessions ≤ 2 s; attach steals the session ≤ 3 s with full ring replay; Mac A's viewer (if open) shows "attached elsewhere" and offers re-steal. Round-trip A→B→A preserves the process. |
| AC7 | CLI parity | `+list` shows agent-backed panes with correct pid/tty/cwd; `+send-keys`/`+read`/`+set-banner`/`+set-state` work unchanged on persistent panes. |

### Measured results (E2E, `scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py`)

Scenario used: 2 windows / 5 panes, nested topology with distinct ratios
(Window A `P0 | (P1/P2)` ratios 0.30/0.70; Window B `P3 | P4` ratio 0.40), each
pane running a never-exiting `PANE=n PID=$$` + tick marker. 3 consecutive cycles
per mode, 0 s relaunch gap. Debug build on macOS 26.4.

| AC | Mode | Result | Recovery gap | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| AC2 | `kill -9`, relaunch same binary (T07) | ✅ 3/3 | ~6–8 s | all 5 PIDs unchanged & alive; ticks monotonic across gap; topology exact (±0.01); pre-gap scrollback replayed; agent PID unchanged |
| AC1 | `kill -9` + **bundle swapped on disk**, relaunch (T08) | ✅ 3/3 | ~8 s | as above; main-exec inode replaced each cycle (proof of on-disk swap); agent PID unchanged across the swap |
| AC1 | **graceful quit** + bundle swap, relaunch (T08) | ✅ 3/3 | ~3 s | as above; `isQuitting` manifest path exercised. (An earlier ~45 s "graceful-quit hang" reported against T08 was a **misdiagnosis** — a test-harness zombie-reaping artifact, not an app hang; there is no graceful-quit regression. Fixed harness-side in T08a.) |
| AC3 / AC4 | **reboot-equivalent**: `kill -9` app **and** agent; launchd restarts the agent; relaunch app (T12d, `--agent-restart`) | ✅ 3/3 | ~1.9–3.9 s | launchd (`RunAtLoad`+`KeepAlive`) restarts the agent in **≤ 2 s** (0.0–2.0 s measured); the new agent materializes sessions from `sessions.json` as relaunchable tombstones; app relaunch re-attaches → auto-RELAUNCH spawns each pane fresh (**new child PID, marker re-ran, `--- session restarted ---` banner**); topology rebuilt from the manifest. Honest contract: children die + ring RAM is lost (POSIX), so scrollback restarts — no pre-kill replay until the ring disk snapshot (T13). |
| AC4 (in-place) | **agent crash, app stays up**: `kill -9` agent ONLY (T12e, `--agent-only`) | ✅ 2/2 | ~2.5–3.7 s | the **app process is never relaunched** (asserted); launchd restarts the agent (≤ 2 s), the live app detects the dropped shared connection, re-dials, and rebuilds each open window in place → auto-RELAUNCH (**new child PID, marker re-ran, restart banner**); topology rebuilt from the manifest; local machine pill never shown. Same honest contract as AC3/AC4 (children + ring RAM lost). |

The `--agent-restart` cycle settles each live agent past launchd's 10 s respawn
`ThrottleInterval` before killing it, so the measured restart is the real
single-crash latency of a long-lived agent, not a throttle artifact of rapid
E2E cycling. The debug lineage installs a distinct LaunchAgent label
(`com.dzearing.ghoztty.debug.agent`) so it never collides with the release job;
the harness boots it out on reset so no KeepAlive job lingers after a run.

The swapped bundle is byte-identical (ad-hoc signing binds keychain auth to the
exact code hash; a recompiled binary would prompt on every launch). This is
immaterial to the AC — the restore path reads the layout manifest + surviving
agent, never app-bundle bytes; the full FS-swap → relaunch → re-attach path is
exercised. See `scripts/e2e/README.md`.

## 3. What exists today (inventory)

The fork already contains ~80% of the machinery, built for remote machines.
Everything below was verified in code on branch `users/dzearing/session-persistence`.

### 3.1 `ghoztty-agent` — a session daemon that already outlives viewers

`src/remote/` is ~27.6k lines of Zig; the agent core (`src/remote/agent/`)
~13.3k. The parts that matter here:

- **One daemon owns many PTY sessions.** `SessionStore`/`SessionTable`
  (`src/remote/agent/session.zig:611`, `:438`) maps crypto-random 128-bit
  session ids → live PTY children (`pty_child.zig`, POSIX PTY + Windows
  ConPTY behind one vtable). Max 64 sessions/daemon (`session.zig:49`).
- **Detach ≠ terminate.** Client disconnect only unbinds the session
  (`server.zig:393` `detachAll`); the child keeps running and its output keeps
  flowing into a per-session **2 MB byte ring** (`session.zig:176`,
  `default_ring_bytes` at `:54`).
- **Re-attach replays the gap byte-exactly.** `ATTACH{session_id,
  last_byte_offset}` → the agent replays the ring range the client missed
  (`server.zig:784-816`), with a visible `[ghoztty: N bytes of scrollback
  lost]` marker if the ring overran.
- **24 h idle TTL** enforced by a reaper thread (`session.zig:681-724`);
  attached or output-producing sessions never expire.
- **Transports:** `--stdio` (SSH), `--listen` (TCP, loopback-only unless
  overridden, unauthenticated), `--relay` (authenticated WSS to the Azure
  relay). All feed one versioned, muxed frame protocol
  (`src/remote/protocol.zig`, `proto_version = 1`, HELLO-negotiated).
- **Single-instance guard** (flock + heartbeat + takeover,
  `single_instance.zig`), cross-platform POSIX/Windows. The agent has no
  self-update of its own (T550): its binary is owned by the Ghoztty install
  and moves with it.

**Gaps (each becomes a work item in §7):** no session enumeration on the wire
(no LIST frame — a client can only attach to an id it already knows); the
`META` frame + `Session.title/cwd/state` fields exist but are never populated;
**nothing is persisted to disk** — an agent restart loses everything; no
Unix-socket/named-pipe transport; no daemonization (launchd/systemd) — external
supervision is assumed.

### 3.2 The macOS app already renders "a terminal whose PTY lives elsewhere"

- **Emulation and GPU rendering are local for remote surfaces.** A remote
  surface is a normal libghostty `CoreSurface` whose termio backend is
  `.remote` instead of `.exec` (`src/apprt/embedded.zig:1460`
  `remoteBackend()`; `src/termio/Remote.zig`). Only raw PTY bytes cross the
  wire; VT parsing, the grid, scrollback, and Metal rendering all happen in
  the app (`Remote.zig:543` `drainRing()` → `termio.Termio.processOutput`,
  "the same call Exec's ReadThread makes"). **Local render fidelity and GPU
  acceleration are unaffected by where the PTY lives.**
- **Loopback already works.** `ghostty_remote_connection_new_tcp` dials
  localhost; `Machine.isLocalMachine`/`isLoopback`
  (`macos/Sources/Features/Remote/Machine.swift:85-112`) already suppress
  remote-only UI for this-Mac connections. Loopback agents are the standing
  test rig (freeze/thaw reconnect tests were run against them).
- **Reconnect machinery is production-hardened:** per-window state machine
  with backoff ladder, dial+probe, NWPathMonitor and wake kicks, poisoned-
  session circuit breaker, forever background re-dial
  (`BaseTerminalController.swift:1861-2517`), pill UI (`MachinePillView.swift`).
- **`RemoteSessionManifest` already round-trips windows across Sparkle
  relaunch and quit** (`RemoteSessionManifest.swift`): UserDefaults JSON of
  `{relayBase, deviceID, sessionID, name, windowTitle, namePinned, ipcName}`,
  preserved on quit (`AppDelegate.isQuitting`), replayed by
  `restoreRemoteWindows()` at launch — re-ATTACH by session UUID, **process
  not restarted, replayed scrollback included**. This is the exact shape of
  the update-survival story, already shipping for relay windows. Crucially the
  Sparkle quit path (`applicationShouldTerminate` +
  `UpdateDelegate.willInstallUpdateOnQuit`) already flows through the
  manifest-preserving branch.
- **A second, separate restoration system** exists for local windows: AppKit
  `NSWindowRestoration` (`TerminalRestorable.swift`, config
  `window-save-state`) serializes the `SplitTree` (Codable, versioned) with
  per-pane `{pwd, uuid, title}` — but **not the command**, and it re-spawns
  shells rather than re-attaching.

### 3.3 IPC + layout model

- `+list --json` already emits the full window/tab/split tree with per-split
  `direction` + `ratio`, per-leaf title/cwd/pid/tty/name
  (`IPCServer.swift:1406-1560`).
- `SplitTree<SurfaceView>` is fully `Codable` (`SplitTree.swift:371-413`).
- `+rearrange --layout=<JSON>` can impose an exact tree shape + ratios on
  existing panes; `+new-window`/`+split` create panes with cwd/command/env.
- Local PTYs: the **GUI app process owns the PTY master fd**
  (`src/termio/Exec.zig:904-1105`); app death ⇒ master closes ⇒ SIGHUP kills
  the children. No fd passing (`SCM_RIGHTS`) or launchd socket activation
  exists anywhere in the tree.

### 3.4 Relay

The relay (`relay/`, Go + SQLite) already models **account → devices**: stable
device UUIDs, display names, hostnames, hashed credentials, `ListByOwner*`,
and live online state (`relay/store.go`, `directory.go`). "Which machines
exist for this account, which are online, how to dial them" is solved.

## 4. Approaches evaluated

### 4.1 Approach 1 — Local agent as PTY host (generalize `ghoztty-agent`)

Run `ghoztty-agent` on localhost as a per-user daemon. Local windows opt into
persistence by becoming `.remote` surfaces attached to the local agent —
exactly what remote windows are today, minus the network.

- **Update/crash:** the app is a stateless viewer. Sparkle relaunch or
  `kill -9` does not touch the agent or its children. Re-attach by session id
  replays the ring. This is *shipping behavior* for relay windows today
  (§3.2); the work is extending it to local windows.
- **Reboot:** the agent persists per-session metadata (argv, cwd, title, env
  subset) to disk; launchd (`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`) restarts the agent at
  login; sessions come back as "dead — relaunchable" and are restarted with
  their original command/cwd on attach, visibly marked. Approach 4 semantics,
  but owned by the same component, so one code path.
- **Portability:** falls out. A local session and a remote session are the
  same object; the Mac is already enrollable as a relay device. Moving a
  window = ATTACH from elsewhere (which always wins: the agent re-binds a live
  session to the newest attach. The protocol's `attached_elsewhere` + `force`
  fields were specified for a polite steal and are reserved, unset and unread —
  T703).
- **Performance:** emulation and rendering stay in-app (§3.2). The added cost
  per byte is one local socket traversal plus a demux-thread → per-pane-ring →
  async-wake handoff that the remote path already implements. Measured on
  this machine (macOS 26.4, Python echo benchmark — a conservative ceiling;
  the Zig path will be faster): loopback TCP RTT **p50 15 µs / p99 57 µs**,
  Unix socket RTT **p50 7.6 µs / p99 12 µs**; one-way streaming
  **1.6–17.9 GB/s**. That is ~500–1000× below a 120 Hz frame budget
  (8.3 ms) per keystroke round-trip, and ~3 orders of magnitude more
  bandwidth than the fastest terminal output bursts. The in-app hop already
  exists for relay windows and is imperceptible on a ~30 ms WAN link;
  loopback removes the only meaningful term. AC5 verifies end-to-end anyway.
- **Complexity:** the agent core is well-factored (~5.8k lines relevant);
  every gap in §3.1 is an additive frame or module. The genuinely new
  problems: agent updates while sessions are live (§6.6), and the daemon
  becoming a dependency of every persistent terminal (§6.7).

### 4.2 Approach 2 — tmux/screen as the persistence layer

Wrap sessions in tmux, integrate via control mode (iTerm2-style).

- **Pros:** battle-tested process survival for free; no daemon to write.
- **Cons, honestly fatal for this fork:**
  - Control-mode integration is an enormous *ongoing* surface (iTerm2's is
    years of maintenance): layout mapping tmux-tree ↔ `SplitTree`, scrollback
    paging through tmux's own buffer model, escape-sequence translation, tmux
    version skew.
  - **Fidelity:** tmux owns scrollback with its own limits and re-renders
    through its own terminal model — Ghoztty's grid/scrollback (Kitty
    graphics, OSC extensions like 7777/7778 banners/state) would be filtered
    through tmux's passthrough rules. The fork's own OSC features would need
    tmux-passthrough shims.
  - **Windows:** no tmux. The fork has a live Windows port effort and a
    cross-platform agent; tmux forks the persistence story per-OS.
  - **Portability/move:** requires tmux on every remote + a second remoting
    mechanism competing with the existing agent/relay stack.
  - Duplicates what §3.1 shows is already ~built: `ghoztty-agent` *is* a
    detach-surviving session daemon with byte replay, minus a LIST frame.
- **Verdict: rejected.** The fork already owns a better-fitting daemon;
  adopting tmux adds a foreign dependency without covering reboot or Windows.

### 4.3 Approach 3 — PTY fd handoff to the successor app (no daemon)

Pass PTY master fds from the dying app instance to the new one
(`SCM_RIGHTS` over the IPC socket, or launchd fd stashing).

- Solves **update only**: there is no successor process during a crash, and
  nothing survives reboot. Two of the three scenarios remain unsolved.
- Sparkle's relaunch has **no overlap window** where old and new instances
  run concurrently — the old app quits before the new one launches
  (`Autoupdate` replaces the bundle in between). fds would have to be parked
  in a third process that outlives both… which is a daemon, i.e. approach 1
  with extra steps. (launchd can hold *listening sockets* for activation, but
  not arbitrary stashed PTY fds for a future process.)
- The scrollback/grid state lives in the app's memory, so a handoff also
  needs full terminal-state serialization — the hardest part of approach 4 —
  on top of fd gymnastics inside the GUI (fork-unsafe AppKit territory).
- **Verdict: rejected** as a primary. The one place fd-preservation *is*
  attractive is inside the headless agent for its own self-update (§6.6),
  where a single-threaded exec-in-place is tractable.

### 4.4 Approach 4 — Session serialization + relaunch only

Extend `TerminalRestorable`/manifest to persist layout + cwd + command (+
optionally scrollback text) and restart everything on launch.

- Simple, no daemon; upstream Ghostty discusses this as "window restoration".
- **Fails the hard requirement:** processes are killed on every update. A
  restarted `npm run dev` is not the same as one that never died; a restarted
  Claude Code session loses its in-memory context.
- **Verdict: not sufficient alone — but it is the required *fallback layer***
  for reboot, agent crash, and TTL-reaped sessions. Approach 1 subsumes it by
  putting the serialized metadata in the agent + an app-side layout manifest.

### 4.5 Approach 5 (recommended) — Hybrid: local agent + serialized manifest

Approach 1 for process survival (update/crash, and cross-machine attach), with
approach 4's serialization as the recovery floor (reboot, agent death), both
hanging off components that already exist (`ghoztty-agent`,
`RemoteSessionManifest`, `SplitTree` Codable). Detailed in §5.

### 4.6 Comparison

| Criterion | 1 Local agent | 2 tmux | 3 fd handoff | 4 serialize+relaunch | **5 hybrid (1+4)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Survives app update | ✅ process alive | ✅ process alive | ✅ (fragile) | ❌ restarted | ✅ process alive |
| Survives app crash | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ restarted | ✅ |
| Reboot recovery | ⚠️ metadata only | ❌ (tmux dies too) | ❌ | ✅ (its whole point) | ✅ relaunch + layout + snapshot |
| Layout/ratio/title fidelity | ✅ app-side manifest | ⚠️ tmux-tree mapping | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scrollback fidelity | ✅ ring replay (configurable depth) | ⚠️ tmux buffer model | ⚠️ needs state serialization | ⚠️ text snapshot only | ✅ ring + disk snapshot |
| Remote parity / window move | ✅ same mechanism | ❌ second mechanism | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

| New complexity in fork | ⚠️ moderate, additive | 🔴 large, foreign | 🔴 high, narrow payoff | 🟡 low | ⚠️ moderate |
| Single point of failure | agent daemon (small, stable) | tmux server | — | — | agent daemon, with §4.4 as floor |

## 5. Recommended architecture

**One sentence:** every persistent terminal is a `ghoztty-agent` session —
the local agent is just the nearest agent — and the app keeps a durable
manifest of *layout + session ids* so any viewer can rebuild its windows and
re-attach; the agent keeps durable *session metadata* so even it can rebuild
processes after a reboot.

### 5.1 Ownership of state

| State | Owner | Persisted where | Restored how |
|---|---|---|---|
| Child process + PTY | agent | — (kernel) | survives viewer death; relaunched after reboot |
| Output ring (recent bytes) | agent | RAM; snapshot to disk on shutdown + periodic (§5.4) | replayed on ATTACH |
| Session metadata (argv, cwd, title, env subset, created-at) | agent | `~/.config/ghoztty/sessions.json` (atomic tmp+rename) | agent relaunch offers "dead — relaunchable" |
| Window/tab/split layout, ratios, user titles, IPC names, session ids | viewer | `SessionLayoutManifest` v2 (UserDefaults or JSON file) | replayed at app launch → windows rebuilt → ATTACH per leaf |
| Grid/scrollback (parsed) | viewer | not persisted (derived) | re-derived from ring replay |
| Which machines exist / are online | relay | SQLite | machine chooser + LIST |

### 5.2 The local agent

- **Transport:** new Unix-domain-socket listener
  (`~/.config/ghoztty/agent.sock`, mode 0600, `LOCAL_PEERCRED` uid check) —
  `socket_stream.zig` is the template; all transports already share one
  `Stream` vtable. Loopback TCP (`--listen`) stays as the dev/test path but is
  **not** the default: a 127.0.0.1 port is connectable by any local user,
  a 0600 unix socket is not. (Windows later: named pipe with per-user ACL,
  matching the fork's Windows effort.)
- **Lifecycle:** installed as a per-user LaunchAgent
  `com.dzearing.ghoztty.agent` (`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`; the app writes the
  plist on first use, same pattern as the Sparkle helper). The app also
  spawns it on-demand if the socket is dead (dial → fail → spawn → retry),
  so persistence works even before login-item approval. Single-instance
  guard already handles the race.
- **New protocol surface** (additive, HELLO-versioned):
  - `LIST_SESSIONS` / `SESSIONS` — enumerate `{id, state(alive|dead),
    title, cwd, argv, attached, created_at, exit_code?}`. The store is
    already internally enumerable (the Windows tray does it).
  - `META` actually populated: agent-side OSC 0/2 (title) + OSC 7 (cwd)
    *sniffing* is *not* needed — titles/cwd parse client-side today; instead
    the client reports title/cwd back via a small `SET_META` so a headless
    session still lists usefully, and `queryCwd` (already implemented per-OS)
    fills cwd on demand.
  - `RELAUNCH{session_id}` — restart a dead session from persisted metadata,
    returning a fresh attachable session that inherits the old id's manifest
    slot.
- **Policy changes for local persistence:**
  - TTL: sessions referenced by a viewer manifest are **pinned** (no 24 h
    reap); pin is an ATTACH-time flag persisted in session metadata. Unpinned
    (ad-hoc remote) sessions keep today's TTL.
  - Session cap raised from 64 → 256 (user runs many windows); ring memory
    capped globally (e.g. 512 MB budget) with per-session degradation.
  - Ring size configurable (`persistent-scrollback-bytes`, default 16 MB per
    session): at libghostty parse throughput (>100 MB/s) a full 16 MB replay
    costs <200 ms on attach, satisfying AC1's 10 s budget with room to spare.

### 5.3 The viewer

- **Config:** `session-persistence = off | on` (per-window override via
  `+new-window --persist=...`). When on, local window creation routes through
  `remoteBackend()` with a connection to the local agent instead of `.exec`.
  `Machine.isLocalMachine` already suppresses the remote pill; extend it to
  show reconnect states only when something is actually wrong.
- **Manifest v2** (`SessionLayoutManifest`, superseding
  `RemoteSessionManifest` and coexisting with AppKit restoration): per window
  `{machineRef (local|deviceID|host:port), tabColor, frame, titleOverride,
  ipcName, layout: SplitTreeCodable, leaves: [{sessionID, title, ipcName}]}`.
  `SplitTree` is already Codable; the delta is recording a session id per
  leaf instead of respawn config. Same mark-don't-drain crash safety and
  `isQuitting` preservation semantics as today.
- **Restore at launch:** for each manifest window → dial machine → for the
  root leaf reuse the existing `presentRemoteWindow(sessionID:)` path; for
  additional leaves, rebuild the tree (`SplitTree` node-by-node, each leaf a
  `.remote` surface with its `sessionID`) — a native, exact-ratio version of
  what `+split` + `+rearrange --layout` can already approximate over IPC.
  Dead sessions render with a "process exited / restarted after reboot"
  banner (the sticky-banner feature is a natural fit) and follow
  `session-relaunch = restore | rerun | prompt`.

  **The default is `restore` (T230, 2026-07-31; named `notify` here until T823
  aligned the three values with the Mac seat's), and it does NOT respawn.**
  A recorded command is never re-executed on the user's behalf: it was
  captured in a world that no longer exists, it may be a build, a migration
  or an agent loop that must not run twice, and it was never asked for a
  second time. Under `restore` the pane comes up on a fresh shell in the
  recorded working directory, with a notice naming the old command so it can
  be copied and re-issued deliberately (`src/termio/session_notice.zig`,
  emitted both as terminal text and as an OSC-7778 sticky banner, because a
  ConPTY shell's startup repaint erases the former). `rerun` keeps the old
  `RELAUNCH`-with-divider behavior, `prompt` waits for a keystroke; both are
  opt-ins now.

  A recorded working directory that no longer EXISTS falls back to the user's
  home rather than failing the spawn (`PtySpawner.resolveSpawnCwd`) — a
  deleted worktree used to leave every restored pane dead.
- **Window geometry: two stores, one precedence rule (T220).** Two files
  record window geometry on Windows and they answer different questions:
  the placement memory (`window_placement[-debug]`, T85) is one global
  "last user-chosen size" read by NEW windows, and the session-layout
  manifest carries a per-window `frame` replayed by restore. **The manifest
  is authoritative for a restored window's frame; the placement memory is
  authoritative for a new window's size.** The invariant that makes that
  safe: the manifest's frame must never be STALER than the placement
  memory. Both are therefore written at the same user gesture — drag end
  (`WM_EXITSIZEMOVE`) and maximize/restore transitions, in
  `Window.savePlacement` — with the manifest sync FIRST, so a crash between
  the two writes can only leave stale the store that restore does not read.
  Before T220 the manifest ride was a 250ms debounce (`markLayoutDirty`),
  and a kill inside it restored the pre-resize frame over a newer placement
  memory. Acceptance: `test/win32/session-layout-geometry-race.ps1`.
- **Sparkle:** no new hook strictly needed — the update path already sets
  `isQuitting` and preserves the manifest (§3.2). Add belt-and-braces: on
  `willInstallUpdateOnQuit`, flush the manifest and send explicit `DETACH`s
  so the agent marks a clean checkpoint (and snapshots rings to disk).

### 5.4 Scrollback strategy (fidelity, honestly)

- **Update/crash:** the viewer's parsed scrollback dies with the viewer; the
  restored window's scrollback is the ring replayed from byte 0 — i.e. the
  last `persistent-scrollback-bytes` of raw output, byte-exact, including
  colors/attributes since it re-parses the original bytes. Beyond the ring, a
  visible truncation marker (already implemented). 16 MB ≈ tens of thousands
  of lines — in practice "full scrollback" for the AC1 workloads; genuinely
  unbounded history is out of scope v1 (future: ring spill-to-disk).
- **Reboot:** the agent snapshots each ring to disk on graceful shutdown
  (SIGTERM from launchd at logout/shutdown) and every 30 s (dirty sessions
  only, atomic writes). After reboot the relaunched pane replays the snapshot
  *then* a `--- session restarted after reboot ---` divider, then live
  output. Best-effort by design (kernel panic loses ≤ 30 s of tail).
- **Alternate-screen apps** (vim, htop): byte replay re-enters the alternate
  screen naturally; a post-attach `RESIZE` (rows±0 trick or SIGWINCH) nudges
  TUIs to repaint — same trick the reconnect path uses today.
- **Future upgrade (not v1):** a true grid snapshot frame
  (`snapshot_at_offset` is an acknowledged stub, `session.zig:27-31`) for
  instant attach without replay cost and eviction-invisible scrollback.

#### 5.4.1 Which panes get the delta attach, and which take the replay (T413)

There are two re-attach paths and it is deliberate that not every pane gets the
faster one.

| Path | When | Attach |
|---|---|---|
| **WP-D3 delta** (T109) | the pane is restored from the LOCAL `session-layout.json`, which carries a per-pane screen snapshot | `offset=N snapshot=M` — we paint our own repaint, the agent gap-fills `(N, S]` |
| **Replay** | the pane is restored from an AGENT-held layout blob: "Restore All" (T335/T336), or a single session resumed from the chooser's roster | `offset=0 snapshot=0` — the agent replays its ring, then appends its own grid snapshot |

The blob deliberately carries no snapshot (`layout_blobs.serializeWindow`
strips it): a blob is a topology mirror re-pushed on every layout mutation, and
`blobHash` skipping unchanged windows is what keeps that mirror cheap. A
per-pane VT dump would change on every capture, so every window would re-upload
forever, and the agent would hold two orders of magnitude more per window.

**That is not the pre-T109 loss it looks like.** Two later changes cover the
replay path: T106 reflows the client grid to the agent-reported capture geometry
for the replay and back to the live grid once it is applied, and FIX 2 has the
agent append a self-contained VT repaint of the visible screen **generated at
the geometry the attaching client just asked for** (`server.zig` `want_snapshot`
→ `session.zig gridSnapshotAlloc`). A blob-sourced pane therefore comes up with
an exact visible screen. What remained was the replay's wire cost (up to the ring
size per pane, over a relay for the cross-machine case) and imperfect scrollback
for ring segments drawn at older geometries.

**And a stored snapshot could not close that.** A blob's snapshot would be
whatever viewer last pushed it, at that viewer's geometry and offset — stale by
construction for a machine still in use, and a stale offset makes the agent emit
its "bytes of scrollback lost" marker for bytes it still holds. The agent's own
snapshot is fresh, correctly sized, and free. The single thing it lacked was
scrollback.

So the remaining gap belonged to the **agent**, and **T621 closed it there**.
The emulator now runs with a bounded `max_scrollback`
(`grid_snapshot.max_scrollback_bytes`, 1 MiB — a deliberate second per-session
allocation beside the 2 MB raw ring, which puts the agent's per-session ceiling
at ~3 MB), and `snapshotAlloc` takes a `SnapshotOptions` saying whether to
serialize that history ahead of the visible screen. On a **snapshot-less attach**
(`last_byte_offset == 0` — a blob-rebuilt pane, or a cross-machine resume of a
single session, which has no local manifest entry either and which no blob change
could ever have helped) the agent sends the scrollback-bearing repaint and
**skips the raw ring replay entirely**. The history is therefore reflowed to the
geometry the client just asked for, which is the one thing a concatenation of
ring segments can never be.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **A delta re-attach is unchanged.** `opts.scrollback` defaults to false and the
  formatter range is then pinned to the ACTIVE area, so a client that already
  holds this history is not sent it a second time and still gets its gap-fill.
- **The skip follows the snapshot, not the intent.** `handleAttach` serializes
  BEFORE deciding what to replay; a session with no emulator (one that has
  produced no output, or whose ring was restored from disk into a fresh process)
  yields no repaint, and the ring replay stands as it always did. Skipping on
  intent alone would have turned a failed serialization into a blank pane.
- **It is negotiated as a PAIR.** The payload growing and the ring replay
  disappearing are one change, so `capability.grid_scrollback` gates both halves
  (`Negotiated.grid_scrollback`, requiring `grid_snapshot`). Every skew
  combination degrades to exactly today's behavior: an older app keeps the
  screen-only repaint AND the ring it depends on. The app logs which path it took
  — `attach: … scrollback=<bool>` in `termio/Remote.zig` — because the two are
  indistinguishable from outside and cost very differently.

T413 remains the decision not to solve any of this in the topology mirror.

#### 5.4.2 The layout blob has TWO schemas, and the reader reconciles them (T337)

The agent stores a layout blob verbatim and never looks inside it
(`layout_meta.zig`). "Opaque" describes the agent's relationship to the bytes,
not the absence of a schema — the schema is a contract between two **viewers**,
and the two lineages never shared one:

| | macOS | win32 |
|---|---|---|
| Type | `SessionLayoutManifest.Entry` | `session_layout.Window` |
| Keys | camelCase (`sessionID`) | snake_case (`session_id`) |
| One blob is | one **tab** (siblings share `tabGroupID`, order by `tabIndex`) | one **window** (a `tabs` array) |
| Split tree | nested `tree`; Swift enum cases wrap their payload in `_0` | flat `nodes` array; splits hold `left`/`right` indices |

The consequence used to be silent: Restore All pointed across lineages decoded
nothing and reported "nothing to restore" — a feature that looked present and
was not.

**The fix is on the read side, and it has to be.** There is no version or
lineage tag to add, because the blobs already sitting in live agents predate any
tag we could introduce now — an agent outlives the app that wrote its blobs by
design (see docs/claude/sessions.md, "Agent contract & upgrade compatibility"), so an envelope
would describe only future blobs while the old ones stayed undecodable. A reader
that tolerates the other shape is therefore required either way, which makes it
the whole fix rather than half of one.

So a reader:

1. **Identifies the blob by shape** — a Mac entry has a `tree` and no `tabs`; a
   win32 window has `tabs` and no `tree`.
2. **Translates** the other lineage's into its own vocabulary. win32 does this
   in `apprt/win32/mac_layout_blob.zig`: it flattens the nested tree into
   indexed `nodes`, maps the leaf fields, and groups Mac's per-tab entries back
   into one window per `tabGroupID` in `tabIndex` order — the same regrouping
   Mac's own `SessionLayoutRestore` does. The mirror (a Mac viewer reading a
   win32 blob) is **T622**.
3. **Skips what it still cannot read**, counting it rather than failing. One bad
   blob must not cost the user the other five windows.

Two things deliberately do NOT survive the translation:

- **The WP-D3 snapshot pair.** Mac's `layoutBlob` encodes the whole entry,
  snapshots included, where win32's `serializeWindow` strips its own. Carrying
  one across would paint another viewer's screen into this pane and ATTACH at
  that viewer's stale offset — exactly the failure §5.4.1 exists to prevent — so
  the translator drops it and the pane takes the replay path like every other
  blob-sourced pane.
- **The window ORIGIN.** Cocoa measures y up from the bottom-left of the primary
  screen, win32 down from the top-left, and the blob records no source-screen
  height, so the flip cannot be undone from the data. The origin is passed
  through (landing the window vertically mirrored but on screen) and
  `restore_frame.reanchor` re-centers anything that lands on no monitor at all.
  Centering every translated window instead would stack a whole restored session
  on one spot, which is worse for the multi-window case the feature exists for.
  Recording the source screen's geometry as an additive field is **T623**.

#### 5.4.3 A session id does not imply a continuous byte stream (T653)

**The rule, normatively: a session ID is stable across an agent restart; its
output BYTE STREAM is not. A client must never trust a resume point it has not
checked against the peer's current stream head.**

This is a property of the protocol, not an accident to be fixed later. It is
written here because T532 cost two investigation contexts rediscovering it from
a frozen pane.

Why the stream restarts. `SessionStore.preloadRingSnapshot`
(`src/remote/agent/session.zig`) is what brings a session back after the agent
process dies: it loads the session's on-disk ring snapshot, **re-bases it at
offset 0**, appends the restart divider, and anchors `out_offset` at the ring
tail, so a RELAUNCH's first live byte lands immediately after the divider. The
id, meanwhile, is deliberately reused — it is what `sessions.json` records and
what the viewer's manifest names, and reusing it is the whole reboot floor.

So after an agent restart, id `X` names a stream that begins at 0 (well, at a
few KB of surviving scrollback) while every manifest and every previously
attached viewer still holds offsets from the stream that died — `43394044`
against a minutes-old agent, in the incident that produced T532.

The base-0 renumbering is not the thing to change:

- **Carrying the tally would make the numbering honest while the DATA stays
  dishonest.** Only a ring's worth of bytes survives a restart, so a session
  resumed at offset 43 MB could serve no replay and fill no gap below its own
  head; it would trade a detectable mismatch for an undetectable one.
- **A non-zero base manufactures a phantom gap.** A freshly restored viewer
  applies DATA from 0 with no resync watermark, and would read any higher base
  as scrollback it had lost.
- **Retiring the id instead** (minting a new one on every relaunch, old id
  recorded as predecessor) was considered and rejected: it would put a breaking
  change through the app↔agent compatibility boundary and through every
  consumer that assumes ids are stable — manifests, layout blobs, the chooser's
  roster, `+sessions` — to remove a mismatch that a two-line clamp already
  handles correctly on the side that actually cares.

What the rule obliges each side to do:

- **The agent** reports its current head on every attach, as
  `ATTACHED.snapshot_at_offset`. That field is the contract; it is not
  advisory.
- **The client** clamps its recorded resume point to that head before arming
  any resync watermark — `Connection.resumeOffset(last_byte_offset,
  agent_head)`, with `termio.Remote` rebasing its own `attach_offset` onto the
  clamped value so the NEXT manifest write is not written into the phantom
  future either. A head of `0` never clamps: it is ambiguous between "produced
  nothing" and "peer too old to report one".
- **A holder-backed session negotiates rather than assumes.** `holder_offset`
  in `sessions.json` records where the snapshot ENDS in the *holder's* stream
  and is sent as the re-adopting agent's ATTACH ack — the same principle one
  layer down: continuity is something the two ends agree on explicitly, never
  something an identifier implies.

Locked in by `test "agent restart renumbers a session's byte stream to base 0:
the id survives, the tally does not"` (agent lane) — a session whose ring
evicted, restored under the same id, must come back with a head strictly BEHIND
where the dead stream stood — and by the `resumeOffset` / `attachChannel` unit
tests in the `none` lane, which fail on the user-visible freeze rather than on a
mismatched number.

### 5.5 Portability / moving windows

- The Mac enrolls as a relay device (already supported; this Mac has a device
  id). The machine chooser gains a per-machine session list: dial → 
  `LIST_SESSIONS` → "Terminals on MaximusHome (3)" with title/cwd/liveness.
- **Move = re-attach elsewhere.** ATTACH from machine B takes the
  single-viewer slot — no `force` needed, since the agent re-binds a live
  session to the newest attach (T703: `attached_elsewhere` and `force` are
  reserved and unimplemented). The losing viewer is currently told nothing; the
  design here wants it to get a `DETACHED{reason=stolen}` frame and show a
  placeholder pane: "Attached on Mac B — [Take back]" (T1506). Its
  manifest entry stays, so "take back" is one click and reboot-restore on A
  doesn't resurrect a window B now owns without saying so (it restores as the
  placeholder).
- Local→remote viewing needs the *local* agent reachable from B: that is the
  relay path (Mac agent runs `--relay` in addition to the unix socket — one
  daemon, two listeners; multi-transport is already how `--listen`+relay
  coexist structurally).

### 5.6 CLI surface (automation parity)

- `ghoztty +sessions [--machine=<name>] [--json]` — LIST_SESSIONS.
- `ghoztty +attach --session=<id> [--window=<name>]` — attach/steal into a
  new or existing window.
- `+new-window --persist=on|off`, `+list` gains `session_id` +
  `persistent: true` per leaf.
- `+detach --target=<name>` — detach a window (leave processes running,
  drop the manifest entry ⇒ intentional "background this").

## 6. Risks, costs, and honest failure modes

1. **The agent becomes a single point of failure.** Agent crash = SIGHUP to
   every persistent child (PTY master closes; on Windows the job object kills
   by design). Mitigations: the agent is small (~13 kLOC), headless, changes
   rarely, and already soak-tested by relay dogfooding; launchd `KeepAlive`
   restarts it; §5.4 snapshots + §5.1 metadata make the recovery floor equal
   to approach 4 (relaunch with layout + scrollback tail), not zero. This is
   a strict improvement over today, where the SPOF is the huge, weekly-
   changing GUI app.
2. **Agent updates vs live sessions.** Today's self-update is idle-gated and
   would never fire once sessions are long-lived. v1 policy: the local agent
   does **not** self-update; it's versioned with the app bundle, and the app
   only bumps it when the protocol version changes (HELLO negotiation keeps
   old-agent/new-app pairs working — additive frames only). The real fix,
   phase 5: **exec-in-place fd preservation** — serialize the session table,
   clear `FD_CLOEXEC` on PTY masters, `execve` the new binary with
   `--resume-state`; children never notice. Tractable precisely because the
   agent is a small single-purpose process (unlike approach 3's GUI variant).
3. **Latency regression risk on huge output bursts.** The per-wake drain cap
   (32 chunks, `Remote.zig:558-577`) and flow control were tuned for WAN;
   loopback can deliver much faster. AC5's `cat 100MB` test gates this;
   knobs exist (chunk size, cap) if needed.
4. **Environment semantics change.** Children of a LaunchAgent daemon don't
   inherit the GUI app's environment (e.g. env vars from a shell that
   launched Ghoztty). Shells still get full login-shell treatment (`-lic`
   convention already implemented per-shell). Documented behavior change
   gated behind the config flag.
5. **Two restoration systems during migration.** AppKit `TerminalRestorable`
   (non-persistent windows) and Manifest v2 (persistent ones) coexist;
   a window is in exactly one system, keyed off its backend kind — same
   pattern as today's local/remote split, but it's real complexity.
6. **Debug ergonomics.** Every persistent terminal now involves two
   processes. Investment required: `ghoztty +agent-status`, agent log at
   `~/.config/ghoztty/agent.log` (exists), and the debug app using a separate
   agent socket + LaunchAgent label (`…debug`), mirroring the existing
   debug-socket separation.
7. **Memory.** 256 sessions × 16 MB ring worst-case = 4 GB — hence the global
   ring budget with per-session degradation (§5.2), and rings only allocate
   as they fill.

## 7. Gaps to build (delta list)

Agent (`src/remote/agent/`): unix-socket transport; LIST_SESSIONS/SET_META/
RELAUNCH frames; pinned-session TTL policy; session metadata persistence
(sessions.json); ring disk snapshot + restore; launchd plist install/health;
session cap + ring budget; (phase 5) exec-in-place resume.

Viewer (macos/): `session-persistence` config; local-machine connection
bootstrap (spawn-on-demand); Manifest v2 with SplitTree layout + per-leaf
session ids; multi-leaf restore path; dead-session banner + relaunch UX;
stolen-session placeholder; chooser session lists; pill behavior for local
agent.

CLI (`src/cli/`): `+sessions`, `+attach`, `+detach`, `--persist`, `+list`
additions.

Relay: none required for v1 (device model suffices); later maybe session-count
in device list.

## 8. Phased plan

Each phase is independently shippable and useful.

> **Status (2026-07-16):** Phases 1–3 are **complete and E2E-verified**
> (Phase 1 groundwork: T09/T09b/T09c UDS + peercred, T10 `+sessions`, T11
> pinning/caps, T12d launchd; Phase 2 headline: T04/T05/T06/T07/T08; Phase 3
> reboot floor: T12/T12b/T12c/T12e relaunch + T13/T13b ring snapshots). Phase 0
> was folded into the T04–T08 build (AC5's latency micro-benchmark was **not**
> separately measured — the loopback path proved fast enough in practice but
> has no recorded p50). **Phase 4 (cross-machine move, AC6) is not built** —
> tracked as T16–T18. Phase 5 is future work.

- **Phase 0 — Spike & gate (≈1 day).** Wire a debug-app local window through
  a loopback `--listen` agent by hand (no new code beyond a config hack).
  Measure AC5 end-to-end: keypress→echo latency (local `.exec` vs loopback
  `.remote`), `cat 100MB`, 120 Hz scroll. Kill the app, relaunch, re-attach
  by session id (manifest already does this for relay windows — point it at
  loopback). **Gate: AC5 numbers hold.** Transport-level RTT already
  measured (§4.1); this validates the full path.
- **Phase 1 — Agent groundwork.** Unix-socket transport + peercred; LIST/
  SET_META/RELAUNCH; pinning; caps/budgets; launchd packaging;
  `+sessions`/`+attach` CLI against it. Exit: AC7 pieces for enumeration;
  agent survives `launchctl kickstart -k` with sessions relaunching from
  metadata.
- **Phase 2 — Persistent local windows (the headline).** Config flag; local
  windows dial the local agent; Manifest v2 with layout + session ids;
  multi-leaf restore. Exit: **AC1 (Sparkle update) and AC2 (kill -9) pass
  with 10 windows / 25 panes.**
- **Phase 3 — Reboot recovery.** sessions.json relaunch flow; ring disk
  snapshots; restart banners; `session-relaunch` policy. Exit: **AC3, AC4.**
- **Phase 4 — Cross-machine attach & move.** Chooser session lists; steal +
  placeholder + take-back; local agent optionally on the relay. Exit: **AC6.**
- **Phase 5 — Fidelity & polish.** Agent exec-in-place update; grid
  snapshots; ring spill-to-disk (unbounded scrollback); Windows named-pipe
  local persistence aligned with the Windows port.

## 9. Open questions (for the user)

1. Default-on or opt-in? Recommendation: opt-in (`session-persistence = on`)
   for a release, then default-on once AC1–AC4 soak.
2. Scrollback retention default: 16 MB/session ring OK, or is disk-spill
   (unbounded) wanted sooner than phase 5?
3. Reboot relaunch policy default: auto-relaunch every command, or prompt
   per pane? (Auto matches "dev servers just come back"; prompt is safer for
   destructive commands.)
4. Should *non*-persistent local windows keep existing AppKit restoration, or
   is Manifest v2 worth unifying on eventually?
