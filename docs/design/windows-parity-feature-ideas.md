# Feature-ideas ledger

Every idea ever suggested in the digest's **Feature ideas** tab, dated. The
daily generator (go.md step 0.7) reads this FIRST and must not re-suggest
anything here — an old idea may return only with a materially new angle,
marked as such. Append-only; one dated section per day, in the same commit
as the digest that showed them.

- Warm the first frame (measure and cut double-click to first usable prompt)

## 2026-09-07

- Ship the evening's work, not the morning's (publish on the day's last good commit, not a clock)
- See what you are about to update to (update prompt names the changes, not a version number)
- Drag a pane out into its own window (and drop it back onto another window's strip)
- Zoom one pane to fill the window, temporarily (chord to swell the focused pane and back)

- Dim the panes that are not yours right now (contrast falloff on unfocused panes)
- A release the loop cannot forget to cut (publish on the day's last good commit, supervisor as backstop)
- Tell me the gap in the app, not the digest (About names commits and headline fixes waiting)
- A harness that has never gone red is not a harness (extend the demonstration rule to acceptance scripts)

## 2026-09-09

- Tell me what this release fixes, in my words (update prompt shows plain-language headlines from the tasks it carries)
- A pane that reads back what you pasted (one-line summary of a multi-line paste before you hit Enter)
- Search everything this window has printed (find-in-page for terminal scrollback, hits marked in the scrollbar)
- Bookmark this spot in the scrollback (drop a mark, jump back after a noisy command)
- A quiet hour (hold every notification until you turn it off, then say what was held)
- Publish the moment work is worth publishing (release on the day's last good commit, not a clock hour)
- Measure the pane, not the theory (standing pane-vs-conhost throughput benchmark script)
- A guard that reports its own age in the app (summarise guard-due to a count plus exceptions)

## 2026-09-12

- Explain what just went wrong, without leaving the terminal (select output, answer opens in a viewer pane)

- Protect a pane from an accidental close (pin a pane so Ctrl+W asks first)
- Tell me the instant a remote pane drops, and offer the way back (toast plus one-click reconnect)
- A crash that files its own report (next launch offers the captured stack with one button to send)
